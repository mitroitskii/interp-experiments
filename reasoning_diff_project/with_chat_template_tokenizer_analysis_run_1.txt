Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.3. As shown in the figure, a toy ant starts crawling from point $O$. On the $n$-th time, it first crawls $n$ units to the right, then $n$ units upwards, reaching point $A_{n}$. Then, it continues crawling from point $A_{n}$. If point $O$ is denoted as $(0,0)$, point $A_{1}$ as $(1,1)$, point $A_{2}$ as $(3,3)$, point $A_{3}$ as $(6,6), \cdots$, then point $A_{100}$ is denoted as $\qquad$.<think>/n

The ant starts at the origin \((0,0)\) and moves \(n\) units to the right and then \(n\) units upwards on the \(n\)-th move. Therefore, the coordinates of point \(A_n\) can be determined by summing the movements in the x and y directions.

The x-coordinate of \(A_n\) is the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers, and the y-coordinate of \(A_n\) is also the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula:
\[
S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
So, the coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) will be:
\[
A_{100} = \left( \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}, \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} \right) = (5050, 5050)
\]

Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
# Calculate the coordinates of point A_100
n = 100
x_coordinate = n * (n + 1) // 2
y_coordinate = n * (n + 1) // 2

print(((x_coordinate, y_coordinate)))
```
```output
(5050, 5050)
```
The coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) are \(\boxed{(5050, 5050)}\).<|endoftext|>

Alex also noticed that all white stripes are of the same width, while black stripes can be wide or narrow, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. How many narrow black stripes does Marty have?<think>/n</think>
To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) be the number of black stripes.
2. Let \( W \) be the number of white stripes.
3. Let \( N \) be the number of narrow black stripes.
4. Let \( W_b \) be the number of wide black stripes.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. There is one more black stripe than white ones: \( B = W + 1 \).
2. All white stripes are of the same width, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones: \( W = N + 7 \).
3. The total number of black stripes is the sum of narrow and wide black stripes: \( B = N + W_b \).

Since the stripes alternate in color, the total number of stripes (black and white) must be odd. Let's denote the total number of stripes by \( T \). Then \( T = B + W \). Since \( B = W + 1 \), we have \( T = (W + 1) + W = 2W + 1 \). This means \( T \) is an odd number.

Now we can use the equations to find the values of \( B \), \( W \), \( N \), and \( W_b \).

First, we substitute \( W = N + 7 \) into \( B = W + 1 \):
\[ B = (N + 7) + 1 = N + 8. \]

Since \( B = N + W_b \), we have:
\[ N + 8 = N + W_b \implies W_b = 8. \]

Now we can find \( W \):
\[ W = N + 7. \]

And we can find \( B \):
\[ B = N + 8. \]

Since \( T = 2W + 1 \), we have:
\[ T = 2(N + 7) + 1 = 2N + 15. \]

Since \( T \) is the total number of stripes, and the stripes alternate in color, the total number of stripes must be odd. This confirms our solution.

Finally, we can find the number of narrow black stripes \( N \). Since \( B = N + 8 \) and \( B \) is the number of black stripes, and the stripes alternate in color, the number of black stripes must be even (since the total number of stripes is odd and the number of white stripes is one less than the number of black stripes). Therefore, \( N \) must be even.

Let's solve for \( N \) using the equations. We know that \( B = N + 8 \) and \( B \) must be even. Let's try different even values for \( N \) and see which one fits all the conditions.

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.Given the line $x-y+1=0$ and the curve $y=\ln x-a$ are tangent, the value of $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.<think>/n Given the line \(x - y + 1 = 0\) and the curve \(y = \ln x - a\) are tangent, we need to find the value of \(a\).

1. **Rewrite the Line Equation:**
   The line equation \(x - y + 1 = 0\) can be rewritten as \(y = x + 1\).

2. **Find the Point of Tangency:**
   Since the line and the curve are tangent, at the point of tangency, the line and the curve must have the same slope and the same y-value.

3. **Find the Slope of the Curve:**
   The slope of the curve \(y = \ln x - a\) is given by its derivative. The derivative of \(y = \ln x - a\) is \(y' = \frac{1}{x}\).

4. **Set the Slopes Equal:**
   At the point of tangency, the slope of the line \(y = x + 1\) is 1, so we set the derivative of the curve equal to 1:
   \[
   \frac{1}{x} = 1 \implies x = 1
   \]

5. **Find the y-value at the Point of Tangency:**
   Substitute \(x = 1\) into the line equation \(y = x + 1\) to find the y-value at the point of tangency:
   \[
   y = 1 + 1 = 2
   \]

6. **Find the Value of \(a\):**
   Substitute \(x = 1\) and \(y = 2\) into the curve equation \(y = \ln x - a\) to find the value of \(a\):
   \[
   2 = \ln 1 - a \implies 2 = 0 - a \implies a = -2
   \]

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to verify our solution.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x, y, a = sp.symbols('x y a')

# Define the line equation y = x + 1
line_eq = x + 1

# Define the curve equation y = ln(x) - a
curve_eq = sp.ln(x) - a

# Find the derivative of the curve equation
curve_derivative = sp.diff(curve_eq, x)

# Set the derivative equal to the slope of the line (which is 1)
slope_eq = sp.Eq(curve_derivative, 1)

# Solve for x
x_tangent = sp.solve(slope_eq, x)[0]

# Find the y-value at the point of tangency using the line equation
y_tangent = line_eq.subs(x, x_tangent)

# Substitute the point of tangency into the curve equation to find a
a_value = sp.solve(sp.Eq(y_tangent, curve_eq.subs(x, x_tangent)), a)[0]

print(a_value)
```
```output
-2
```
The value of \(a\) for which the line \(x - y + 1 = 0\) and the curve \(y = \ln x - a\) are tangent is \(\boxed{-2}\).<|endoftext|>

<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.3. As shown in the figure, a toy ant starts crawling from point $O$. On the $n$-th time, it first crawls $n$ units to the right, then $n$ units upwards, reaching point $A_{n}$. Then, it continues crawling from point $A_{n}$.

To determine the coordinates of point \(A_{100}\), we need to analyze the pattern of the ant's movement. The ant starts at the origin \((0,0)\) and moves \(n\) units to the right and then \(n\) units upwards on the \(n\)-th move. Therefore, the coordinates of point \(A_n\) can be determined by summing the movements in the x and y directions.

The x-coordinate of \(A_n\) is the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers, and the y-coordinate of \(A_n\) is also the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula:
\[
S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
So, the coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) will be:
\[
A_{100} = \left( \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}, \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} \right) = (5050, 5050)
\]

Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
# Calculate the coordinates of point A_100
n = 100
x_coordinate = n * (n + 1) // 2
y_coordinate = n * (n + 1) // 2

print(((x_coordinate, y_coordinate)))
```
```output
(5050, 5050)
```
The coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) are \(\boxed{(5050, 5050)}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

It turned out that there is one more black stripe than white ones. Alex also noticed that all white stripes are of the same width, while black stripes can be wide or narrow, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. How many narrow black stripes does Marty have?<think>/note: Marty the zebra has 18 stripes in total. To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) be the number of black stripes.
2. Let \( W \) be the number of white stripes.
3. According to the problem, there is one more black stripe than white ones, so we have the equation:
   \[
   B = W + 1
   \]
4. The total number of stripes is 18, so we have the equation:
   \[
   B + W = 18
   \]
5. Let \( N \) be the number of narrow black stripes and \( W_b \) be the number of wide black stripes. According to the problem, there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones, so we have the equation:
   \[
   W = W_b + 7
   \]
6. The total number of black stripes is the sum of narrow and wide black stripes, so we have the equation:
   \[
   B = N + W_b
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can substitute \( B = W + 1 \) into \( B + W = 18 \) to find \( W \):
\[
(W + 1) + W = 18 \implies 2W + 1 = 18 \implies 2W = 17 \implies W = 8.5
\]
Since \( W \) must be an integer, we need to check the closest integer values. Let's try \( W = 8 \) and \( W = 9 \).

If \( W = 8 \), then \( B = 9 \). But this doesn't satisfy \( B = W + 1 \).

If \( W = 9 \), then \( B = 10 \). This satisfies \( B = W + 1 \).

So, \( W = 9 \) and \( B = 10 \). Now we can use the equation \( W = W_b + 7 \) to find \( W_b \):
\[
9 = W_b + 7 \implies W_b = 2
\]
Then, using \( B = N + W_b \), we can find \( N \):
\[
10 = N + 2 \implies N = 8
\]

So, the number of narrow black stripes is \( N = 8 \). Let's verify this with Python code to ensure the result is accurate.
```python
# Define the total number of stripes
total_stripes = 18

# Iterate over possible values of W (number of white stripes)
for W in range(total_stripes):
    B = W + 1  # Number of black stripes
    if B + W == total_stripes:
        # Calculate the number of wide black stripes
        W_b = W - 7
        if W_b >= 0 and W_b <= B:
            # Calculate the number of narrow black stripes
            N = B - W_b
            break

print(N)
```
```output
8
```
The number of narrow black stripes on Marty the zebra is \(\boxed{8}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

To find the value of \(a\) such that the line \(x - y + 1 = 0\) is tangent to the curve \(y = \ln x - a\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Express the line in slope-intercept form**: The line \(x - y + 1 = 0\) can be rewritten as \(y = x + 1\). This tells us that the slope of the line is 1.
2. **Find the derivative of the curve**: The derivative of \(y = \ln x - a\) is \(y' = \frac{1}{x}\). At the point of tangency, the slope of the curve must be equal to the slope of the line. So, we set \(\frac{1}{x} = 1\), which gives \(x = 1\).
3. **Find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinate on the curve**: Substitute \(x = 1\) into the equation of the curve \(y = \ln x - a\). This gives \(y = \ln 1 - a = -a\).
4. **Use the point of tangency on the line**: Since the point \((1, -a)\) lies on the line \(y = x + 1\), we substitute \(x = 1\) and \(y = -a\) into the line equation to get \(-a = 1 + 1\), which simplifies to \(-a = 2\). Therefore, \(a = -2\).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to verify our solution.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x, y, a = sp.symbols('x y a')

# Define the curve and the line
curve = sp.ln(x) - a
line = x - y + 1

# Find the derivative of the curve
curve_derivative = sp.diff(curve, x)

# The slope of the line is 1, so we set the derivative of the curve equal to 1
slope_condition = sp.Eq(curve_derivative, 1)

# Solve for x
x_tangent = sp.solve(slope_condition, x)[0]

# Find the y-coordinate of the point of tangency on the curve
y_tangent = curve.subs(x, x_tangent)

# The point (x_tangent, y_tangent) lies on the line y = x + 1
tangency_condition = sp.Eq(y_tangent, x_tangent + 1)

# Solve for a
a_value = sp.solve(tangency_condition, a)[0]

On the n-th time, it crawls n units to the right, then n units up, reaching point A_n. Then it continues from A_n. The given points are A1=(1,1), A2=(3,3), A3=(6,6), etc. We need to find point A100.

Okay, so let's try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the ant starts at point O, which is (0,0). On the first time, it crawls n units to the right, then n units up, reaching point A1. Similarly, on the second time, it crawls n units to the right, then n units up, reaching point A2, and so on.

Given points:
- A1 = (1,1)
- A2 = (3,3)
- A3 = (6,6)
- ...

Wait, let's see the pattern here.

Looking at A1: (1,1)
A2: (3,3)
A3: (6,6)

Hmm, so for A1, the ant crawls 1 unit right and 1 unit up, ending at (1,1).

For A2, it crawls 2 units right and 2 units up, but wait, from A1 to A2, does it just add another 2 units right and 2 units up? But looking at the coordinates:

From A1 (1,1) to A2 (3,3): that's an increase of 2 in both x and y.

Similarly, from A2 (3,3) to A3 (6,6): increase of 3 in both x and y.

Wait, perhaps each time, the ant crawls n units right and n units up on the n-th time.

But let's see:

If on the first time (n=1), it crawls 1 unit right and 1 unit up, ending at (1,1).

On the second time (n=2), it crawls 2 units right and 2 units up, but wait, from A1 to A2, it's moving from (1,1) to (3,3), which is an increase of 2 in both x and y. So perhaps each time, it's adding n units right and n units up.

But let's think about the coordinates.

Given that A1 is (1,1), which is (sum of 1 right, sum of 1 up).

A2 is (3,3), which is (1+2, 1+2).

A3 is (6,6), which is (1+2+3, 1+2+3).

Wait, hold on. Let's see:

If A1 is (1,1), which is sum of 1 right and 1 up.

A2 is (3,3), which is sum of 1+2 right and 1+2 up.

A3 is (6,6), which is sum of 1+2+3 right and 1+2+3 up.

So, in general, point A_n is (sum from k=1 to n of k, sum from k=1 to n of k).

Because each time, the ant crawls n units right and n units up, but wait, no.

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, perhaps each time, the ant crawls n units right and n units up, but starting from the previous point.

But looking at the given points:

A1 is (1,1). So, starting from O(0,0), crawls 1 right, 1 up.

A2 is (3,3). So, from A1(1,1), crawls 2 right, 2 up: (1+2,1+2) = (3,3).

A3 is (6,6). From A2(3,3), crawls 3 right, 3 up: (3+3,3+3) = (6,6).

So, in general, each time, the ant crawls n units right and n units up, starting from the previous point.

Therefore, the coordinates of A_n can be expressed as:

A_n = (sum from k=1 to n of k, sum from k=1 to n of k)

Because each time, it's adding k right and k up.

But wait, let's check:

For n=1: sum from 1 to 1 is 1, so (1,1). Correct.

For n=2: sum from 1 to 2 is 3, so (3,3). Correct.

For n=3: sum from 1 to 3 is 6, so (6,6). Correct.

Therefore, in general, point A_n is (S_n, S_n), where S_n is the sum of the first n natural numbers.

We know that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by S_n = n(n + 1)/2.

Therefore, point A_n is (n(n + 1)/2, n(n + 1)/2).

Therefore, point A_100 would be (100*101/2, 100*101/2).

Compute that:

First, compute 100*101: 100*100=10,000; 100*1=100; so total is 10,100.

Then divide by 2: 10,100 / 2 = 5,050.

Therefore, both coordinates are 5,050.

Hence, point A_100 is (5050, 5050).

Wait, let me verify this.

Given that each A_n is (S_n, S_n), where S_n = n(n + 1)/2.

Therefore, for n=100:

S_100 = 100*101/2 = (100/2)*101 = 50*101 = 5050.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, point A_100 is (5050, 5050).

So, the answer is (5050, 5050), which can be written as \boxed{(5050, 5050)}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{(5050, 5050)}
</think>

The toy ant starts at point \( O \) which is \((0,0)\). On the \( n \)-th time, it crawls \( n \) units to the right, then \( n \) units upwards, reaching point \( A_n \). The given points are \( A_1 = (1,1) \), \( A_2 = (3,3) \), \( A_3 = (6,6) \), etc.

To find point \( A_{100} \):

1. Each point \( A_n \) is reached by summing the first \( n \) natural numbers both in the x-coordinate and y-coordinate.
2. The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is given by \( S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
3. For \( n = 100 \), the sum \( S_{100} \) is calculated as:
   \[
   S_{100} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = 5050
   \]
4. Therefore, point \( A_{100} \) is \((5050, 5050)\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{(5050, 5050)}

How many narrow black stripes does Marty have?<think>/narrow black stripes does Marty have?

Alright, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. It's about counting stripes on Marty the zebra, which has alternating black and white stripes. There are a few conditions given, and we need to find the number of narrow black stripes. Hmm, okay.

First, let's parse the problem:

1. There's one more black stripe than white ones. Wait, but stripes are alternately black and white, so the number of stripes should be odd if it starts with black or white. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the total number of stripes first.

Wait, maybe let's break down the given information:

- There is one more black stripe than white ones. So if we let the number of white stripes be W, then the number of black stripes is W + 1.

But wait, since the stripes alternate, the number of black and white stripes depends on whether the total number of stripes is odd or even. If it starts with black, then the number of black stripes is one more than white if the total is odd. Similarly, if it starts with white, then the number of white stripes is one more. But since the problem says there is one more black than white, so perhaps the total number of stripes is odd, starting with black.

But maybe let's not get bogged down yet. Let's look at the next condition.

- All white stripes are of the same width. So each white stripe has the same width. That might be useful later.

- Black stripes can be wide or narrow. So each black stripe can be either wide or narrow, but all white stripes are same width. Hmm.

- There are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. Wait, so the number of white stripes is 7 more than the number of wide black stripes. Hmm.

We need to find the number of narrow black stripes.

Let me try to structure this.

Let me denote:

- Let W be the number of white stripes.

- Then, the number of black stripes is W + 1, since there is one more black stripe than white.

But wait, since the stripes alternate, if the number of white stripes is W, then the number of black stripes is also W or W + 1, depending on whether it starts with white or black.

Wait, perhaps let's think about the total number of stripes.

If the stripes alternate starting with black, then the number of black stripes is (total + 1)/2, and white stripes is total / 2.

But since there is one more black stripe than white, so:

Number of black stripes = Number of white stripes + 1.

Therefore, if we let W be the number of white stripes, then number of black stripes is W + 1.

But since the stripes alternate, the total number of stripes is W + (W + 1) = 2W + 1.

Therefore, the total number of stripes is odd, starting with black.

Therefore, the number of black stripes is (2W + 1 + 1)/2 = (2W + 2)/2 = W + 1, which matches.

So, okay, moving on.

Now, the next condition: all white stripes are of the same width. So each white stripe has the same width.

Black stripes can be wide or narrow, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones.

Wait, perhaps let's parse this.

It says: "there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones."

So, number of white stripes = number of wide black stripes + 7.

But wait, number of white stripes is W, and number of wide black stripes is something else.

Wait, perhaps let's think about the stripes.

Each black stripe is either wide or narrow. So, for each black stripe, it can be either wide or narrow.

Similarly, each white stripe is of the same width, but we don't know how many stripes there are or their widths.

Wait, perhaps let's think in terms of the number of stripes.

Let me denote:

- Let W be the number of white stripes.

- Then, number of black stripes is W + 1.

But each black stripe can be wide or narrow. Let's denote:

- Let B_w be the number of wide black stripes.

- Let B_n be the number of narrow black stripes.

Therefore, B_w + B_n = number of black stripes = W + 1.

Now, the problem says: "there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones." So, number of white stripes = number of wide black stripes + 7.

Therefore, W = B_w + 7.

So, we have:

1. W = B_w + 7.

2. B_w + B_n = W + 1.

But since W = B_w + 7, substitute into equation 2:

B_w + B_n = (B_w + 7) + 1 => B_w + B_n = B_w + 8 => B_n = 8.

Wait, so is it that straightforward? So the number of narrow black stripes is 8.

But let me verify.

So, let's see:

Given that W = B_w + 7.

And B_w + B_n = W + 1.

Substituting W:

B_w + B_n = (B_w + 7) + 1 => B_w + B_n = B_w + 8 => B_n = 8.

Therefore, regardless of the values of B_w, B_n is 8.

Therefore, the number of narrow black stripes is 8.

But let me check if this makes sense.

So, if W = B_w + 7.

And B_w + B_n = W + 1.

So, substituting W:

B_w + B_n = (B_w + 7) + 1 => B_w + B_n = B_w + 8 => B_n = 8.

Therefore, yes, regardless of the value of B_w, B_n is 8.

Therefore, the number of narrow black stripes is 8.

Therefore, the answer is 8.

But let me think again.

Is there any other condition that might affect this?

We know that all white stripes are of the same width. So perhaps the number of white stripes is equal to the number of white stripes times their width.

But perhaps that's not necessary here because we are only given the number of stripes, not their widths.

Therefore, perhaps the answer is 8.

Therefore, the number of narrow black stripes is 8.

**Final Answer**
The number of narrow black stripes is \boxed{8}.
</think>

Given the problem about counting stripes on Marty the zebra, we need to determine the number of narrow black stripes. Here are the key steps:

1. Let \( W \) be the number of white stripes.
2. The number of black stripes is \( W + 1 \) since there is one more black stripe than white.
3. The number of white stripes is 7 more than the number of wide black stripes. Let \( B_w \) be the number of wide black stripes. Thus, \( W = B_w + 7 \).
4. The total number of black stripes is \( B_w + B_n \), where \( B_n \) is the number of narrow black stripes.
5. Substituting \( W = B_w + 7 \) into the equation for black stripes, we get:
   \[
   B_w + B_n = (B_w + 7) + 1
   \]
6. Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   B_w + B_n = B_w + 8
   \]
   \[
   B_n = 8
   \]

Thus, the number of narrow black stripes is \(\boxed{8}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.Given the line $x-y+1=0$ and the curve $y=\ln x-a$ are tangent, the value of $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.<think>/n
------------------------------------------------------
<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.Given the line $x-y+1=0$ and the curve $y=\ln x-a$ are tangent, the value of $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.<think>/n

Okay, so I have this problem here: the line x - y + 1 = 0 and the curve y = ln x - a are tangent to each other. I need to find the value of a. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that if two curves are tangent to each other, they must touch at exactly one point, and at that point, their slopes (derivatives) must be equal. So, I need to find a point (x, y) that lies on both the line and the curve, and also has the same slope at that point.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. The line: x - y + 1 = 0. Maybe I can express y in terms of x to make it easier. Let's rearrange it: y = x + 1.

2. The curve: y = ln x - a.

So, since they are tangent, there must be a point where both equations are satisfied, and their derivatives are equal.

Let me denote the point of tangency as (x0, y0). Then, y0 must satisfy both equations:

From the line: y0 = x0 + 1.

From the curve: y0 = ln x0 - a.

Therefore, I can set these equal to each other:

x0 + 1 = ln x0 - a.

So, that's one equation: x0 + 1 = ln x0 - a. Let me note this as equation (1).

Now, let's think about the derivatives. The slope of the line is the derivative of the line at any point. Since the line is straight, its slope is constant. Let's compute the derivative of the line.

The line is y = x + 1, so dy/dx = 1. Therefore, the slope of the line is 1.

On the other hand, the slope of the curve y = ln x - a at any point x is given by the derivative of ln x, which is 1/x. So, the slope of the curve at any point x is 1/x.

Since the curves are tangent, their slopes must be equal at the point of tangency. Therefore:

1/x0 = 1.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, 1/x0 = 1 implies that x0 = 1.

Is that correct? Let me check.

If the slope of the line is 1, then the slope of the curve at the point of tangency must also be 1. The derivative of the curve is 1/x, so setting that equal to 1 gives x = 1. Yes, that seems right.

So, x0 = 1. Now, let's plug this back into our earlier equation (1):

x0 + 1 = ln x0 - a.

Substituting x0 = 1:

1 + 1 = ln 1 - a.

Simplify:

2 = 0 - a.

Therefore, 2 = -a, which implies that a = -2.

Wait, let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, the line equation: y = x + 1.

The curve equation: y = ln x - a.

At the point of tangency, both equations must hold, so x + 1 = ln x - a.

Also, the derivatives must be equal. The derivative of the line is 1, and the derivative of the curve is 1/x. So, setting them equal: 1 = 1/x, which gives x = 1.

So, substituting x = 1 into the equation x + 1 = ln x - a:

1 + 1 = ln 1 - a.

Which is 2 = 0 - a, so a = -2.

That seems consistent. Let me also check if the point (1, y0) lies on both the line and the curve.

From the line: y0 = 1 + 1 = 2.

From the curve: y0 = ln 1 - a = 0 - a = -a.

Since y0 must be equal to both, we have -a = 2, so a = -2. That matches.

Therefore, the value of a is -2.

I think that makes sense. Let me just recap:

1. Found the equation of the line in terms of y: y = x + 1.

2. Set the curve equal to the line at the point of tangency: x + 1 = ln x - a.

3. Found the derivative of the line is 1, and the derivative of the curve is 1/x. Set them equal to find x = 1.

4. Substituted x = 1 into both equations to find a = -2.

Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a \) is \boxed{-2}.
</think>

Given the line \( x - y + 1 = 0 \) and the curve \( y = \ln x - a \) are tangent, we need to find the value of \( a \).

First, we express the line in terms of \( y \):
\[ y = x + 1 \]

Since the curves are tangent, they must touch at exactly one point, and their slopes must be equal at that point. The slope of the line \( y = x + 1 \) is 1. The slope of the curve \( y = \ln x - a \) is given by its derivative:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \]

Setting the slopes equal, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{x_0} = 1 \]
which implies:
\[ x_0 = 1 \]

Substituting \( x_0 = 1 \) into the equations of the line and the curve, we find:
From the line:
\[ y_0 = 1 + 1 = 2 \]

From the curve:
\[ y_0 = \ln 1 - a \]
Since \( \ln 1 = 0 \), we have:
\[ y_0 = -a \]

Equating the two expressions for \( y_0 \):
\[ 2 = -a \]
Thus, solving for \( a \):
\[ a = -2 \]

The value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{-2}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

The problem is about the coordinates of point $A_{100}$. The given points are $A_{1}=(1,1)$, $A_{2}=(3,3)$, $A_{3}=(6,6)$, and so on. I need to find a pattern or formula that relates the index $n$ to the coordinates of $A_n$.

First, let's list the coordinates for the first few $A_n$:

- $A_1 = (1,1)$
- $A_2 = (3,3)$
- $A_3 = (6,6)$
- $A_4 = (10,10)$
- $A_5 = (15,15)$
- ...

Looking at these, it seems that each $A_n$ has coordinates $(S_n, S_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers. Wait, but let's check:

- For $A_1$, $S_1 = 1$, so $(1,1)$.
- For $A_2$, $S_2 = 1 + 2 = 3$, so $(3,3)$.
- For $A_3$, $S_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$, so $(6,6)$.
- For $A_4$, $S_4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$, so $(10,10)$.

Yes, that seems correct. So, in general, $A_n$ has coordinates $(S_n, S_n)$, where $S_n$ is the nth triangular number. The formula for the nth triangular number is $S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$.

Therefore, the coordinates of $A_n$ are $\left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}, \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)$.

So, for $A_{100}$, substituting $n = 100$ into the formula:

First, compute $S_{100} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2}$.

Let's compute that step by step:

100 multiplied by 101 is 10100.

Then, divide by 2: 10100 / 2 = 5050.

Therefore, $S_{100} = 5050$.

Thus, the coordinates of $A_{100}$ are $(5050, 5050)$.

Therefore, point $A_{100}$ is denoted as $(5050, 5050)$.

**Final Answer**
The coordinates of point $A_{100}$ are \boxed{(5050, 5050)}.
<|box_end|>

The formula for the \(n\)-th triangular number is:
\[ S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

For \(A_{100}\), we substitute \(n = 100\) into the formula:
\[ S_{100} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} \]

Calculating step by step:
\[ 100 \times 101 = 10100 \]

Okay, so I have this problem where a line and a curve are tangent to each other, and I need to find the value of 'a'. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the given line is x - y + 1 = 0. Maybe I can rewrite this in a more familiar form, like y = mx + b. Let me do that.

Starting with x - y + 1 = 0. Let's solve for y:

x + 1 = y

So, y = x + 1. That's a straight line with a slope of 1 and a y-intercept at 1.

Next, the curve is given as y = ln x - a. So, this is a natural logarithm function shifted down by 'a' units.

Now, the problem states that these two are tangent to each other. That means they touch at exactly one point, and at that point, their slopes (derivatives) are equal.

So, to find the point of tangency, I need to set the equations equal to each other and also set their derivatives equal.

Let me denote the point of tangency as (x, y). Since both equations equal y, I can set them equal to each other:

x + 1 = ln x - a

So, that's one equation. Now, let's also consider the derivatives.

The derivative of the line y = x + 1 is straightforward. It's just dy/dx = 1.

Now, the derivative of the curve y = ln x - a is dy/dx. Let's compute that.

The derivative of ln x is 1/x, and the derivative of -a is 0. So, dy/dx = 1/x.

Since the slopes must be equal at the point of tangency, we have:

1 = 1/x

So, solving for x, we get x = 1.

Okay, so now we know that x is 1. Let's plug this back into our equation from the original functions to find 'a'.

From the line equation: y = x + 1. So, when x = 1, y = 1 + 1 = 2.

From the curve equation: y = ln x - a. When x = 1, y = ln 1 - a. Since ln 1 is 0, this simplifies to y = 0 - a = -a.

But we also know that y is 2 from the line. Therefore:

2 = -a

Solving for 'a', we get a = -2.

Wait, let me double-check that. If x = 1, then from the line equation, y = 2. From the curve equation, y = ln(1) - a = 0 - a = -a. So, setting them equal: 2 = -a, so a = -2. That seems correct.

But let me also verify that the derivatives are indeed equal at x = 1.

The derivative of the line is 1, and the derivative of the curve is 1/x. At x = 1, 1/x is 1. So, yes, both derivatives are equal to 1 at x = 1. That checks out.

Therefore, the value of 'a' is -2.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a \) is \boxed{-2}.
<|box_end|>

Given the line \( x - y + 1 = 0 \) and the curve \( y = \ln x - a \) are tangent, we need to find the value of \( a \).

First, rewrite the line equation in slope-intercept form:
\[ x - y + 1 = 0 \implies y = x + 1 \]

Next, consider the curve \( y = \ln x - a \). Since the line and the curve are tangent, they touch at exactly one point, and their slopes are equal at that point.

The derivative of the line \( y = x + 1 \) is:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = 1 \]

The derivative of the curve \( y = \ln x - a \) is:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \]

Setting the derivatives equal at the point of tangency:
\[ 1 = \frac{1}{x} \implies x = 1 \]

Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the line equation to find \( y \):
\[ y = 1 + 1 = 2 \]

Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the curve equation to find \( a \):
\[ y = \ln 1 - a \implies 2 = 0 - a \implies a = -2 \]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{-2}\).<|endoftext|>
