        "output": "Alright, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.\n\nFirst, I remember that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. That means if I'm adding three primes together, the sum will depend on how many even primes are involved. Since 2 is the only even prime, including it might help in reaching an even total like 100. If I include 2, then the other two primes need to add up to 98 because 100 - 2 = 98. Now, 98 is an even number, and since the sum of two odd numbers is even, that's possible.\n\nSo, let me note that down. If I include 2, then I need two primes that add up to 98. Let's call them p and q, so p + q = 98. Both p and q need to be primes. Since 98 is an even number, and as I thought earlier, adding two odd numbers will give an even sum, that works.\n\nNow, I need to find two primes that add up to 98. Let's list some primes less than 98 and see if any pair adds up to 98. Maybe starting from the lower primes and moving up.\n\nStarting with 3: 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 a prime? Hmm, 95 divided by 5 is 19, so 95 is 5 × 19, which means it's not prime.\n\nNext, 5: 98 - 5 = 93. Is 93 prime? 93 divided by 3 is 31, so 93 is 3 × 31, not prime.\n\nNext prime is 7: 98 - 7 = 91. Is 91 prime? Hmm, 91 divided by 7 is 13, so 91 is 7 × 13, not prime.\n\nNext, 11: 98 - 11 = 87. Is 87 prime? 87 divided by 3 is 29, so 87 is 3 × 29, not prime.\n\nNext, 13: 98 - 13 = 85. 85 divided by 5 is 17, so 85 is not prime.\n\n17: 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9 squared, so not prime.\n\n19: 98 - 19 = 79. Hmm, is 79 a prime? Let me think. 79 is only divisible by 1 and itself. Let me check divisibility by primes less than sqrt(79), which is about 8.9. So, primes up to 7. 79 divided by 2? No. 3? 79/3 is about 26.3, not integer. 5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7? 7×11 is 77, 7×12 is 84, so no. So, 79 is a prime. Great! So, 19 and 79 are both primes, and they add up to 98.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the three primes are 2, 19, and 79. Let me check: 2 + 19 is 21, 21 + 79 is 100. Perfect! So, that works.\n\nWait, but just to make sure there are no other combinations, maybe I should check a few more primes to see if there are other pairs that add up to 98. Let's see.\n\nNext prime after 19 is 23: 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5, so not prime.\n\n29: 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is divisible by 3, so not prime.\n\n31: 98 - 31 = 67. Is 67 prime? Let's check. 67 divided by 2? No. 3? 67/3 is about 22.3, nope. 5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7? 7×9 is 63, 7×10 is 70, so no. 11? 11×6 is 66, 11×7 is 77, so no. So, 67 is prime. So, 31 and 67 are primes that add up to 98. So, another combination is 2, 31, and 67. Let's check: 2 + 31 = 33, 33 + 67 = 100"

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, examples of primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.\n\nFirst off, I remember that except for the prime number 2, all other primes are odd. That might be useful because the sum of three odd numbers would be odd. But 100 is an even number. So, how can we get an even sum from three numbers? Well, if all three were odd, that would be odd + odd + odd = odd + odd = even; wait, no, hold on. Let me correct that. Actually, odd + odd = even, and then even + odd = odd. So, odd + odd + odd = odd. But we need the sum to be even, specifically 100.\n\nSo, that means we can’t have all three primes being odd because three odds add up to an odd number. Therefore, to get an even sum, we must have an even number of odd primes in our triplet. Since 2 is the only even prime, maybe one of the primes should be 2, and the other two would be odd primes. Let me verify that.\n\nIf we have two odd primes and one even prime (which is 2), then the sum would be odd + odd + even = even. That makes sense. So, that gives me a direction: one of the three primes is 2, and the other two need to add up to 98, because 100 - 2 = 98. Now, the problem reduces to finding two primes that add up to 98.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need two primes that sum to 98. Let me think about what primes can make 98. Let's denote the two primes as p and q, such that p + q = 98.\n\nI can start by checking small prime numbers and see if their complement (98 - prime) is also prime.\n\nLet me list down some primes less than 98: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\n\nWait, 97 is a prime less than 98, so I should include that.\n\nNow, let me try subtracting each prime from 98 and see if the result is also prime.\n\nStarting with the smallest prime, 2: 98 - 2 = 96. Is 96 prime? No, 96 is divisible by 2, 3, etc. So, 96 is not prime.\n\nNext prime: 3. 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 prime? 95 ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5, not prime.\n\nNext: 5. 98 - 5 = 93. Is 93 prime? 93 is divisible by 3 (9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3), so 93 is not prime.\n\nNext: 7. 98 - 7 = 91. Is 91 prime? Hmm, 91 is 7 times 13, so no, not prime.\n\nNext: 11. 98 - 11 = 87. Is 87 prime? 8 + 7 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so 87 is not prime.\n\nNext: 13. 98 - 13 = 85. Is 85 prime? 85 is 5 times 17, so no, not prime.\n\nNext: 17. 98 - 17 = 81. Is 81 prime? No, 81 is 9 times 9, so it's not prime.\n\nNext: 19. 98 - 19 = 79. Is 79 prime? Yes! 79 is a prime number. So, 19 and 79 are both primes, and their sum is 98. Perfect!\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, if we take 2, 19, and 79, their sum is 2 + 19 + 79 = 100. Let me verify that again:\n\n2 is a prime number. 19 is a prime number, and 79 is also a prime number. So, yes, that should work.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities, let me continue checking a few more primes.\n\nNext prime after 19 is 23."

        "output": "Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that all primes except 2 are odd. 2 is the only even prime number. So, if I'm adding three primes to get 100, which is an even number, I need to consider the possible combinations of odd and even primes.\n\nSince 100 is even, and the sum of three numbers is involved, I need to think about the parity. The sum of three numbers is even. So, how can that happen? Let me recall, when adding numbers:\n\n- Odd + Odd + Even = Even\n- Odd + Even + Odd = Even\n- Even + Odd + Odd = Even\n\nSo, in each case, to get an even total, you need either three evens or one even and two odds. But since the only even prime is 2, we can have at most one 2 in our triplet of primes. Because 2 is the only even prime, and any other even number greater than 2 isn't prime.\n\nWait, actually, primes can't be even unless they are 2. So, if I use 2 as one of the primes, the other two must be odd primes. Alternatively, if I don't use 2, then all three primes would have to be odd, but 3 odd numbers added together would result in an odd number. Since 100 is even, that's not possible. Therefore, 2 must be one of the primes.\n\nSo, that simplifies it a bit. So, the triplet would be 2, and then two other primes that add up to 98.\n\nTherefore, I need to find two primes that add up to 98.\n\nAlright, so how can I find two primes that sum to 98? Maybe I can think of primes less than 98 and check if their complement is also prime.\n\nLet me note that except for 2, all primes are odd. So, if I take 2, I get 2 and 96, but 96 is not prime. So, no luck there.\n\nLet me think: Let me try starting from lower primes.\n\nStart with 3. Then, 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 prime? No, because 95 is divisible by 5 (95/5=19). So, 95 is not prime.\n\nNext, 5. 98 -5=93. Is 93 prime? 93 is divisible by 3 (93/3=31). So, nope.\n\nNext prime:7. 98 -7=91. 91 is 13*7, which is not prime.\n\nNext:11. 98 -11=87. 87 is 3*29, not prime.\n\nNext:13. 98 -13=85. 85 is 5*17, not prime.\n\nNext:17. 98-17=81. 81 is 9*9, not prime.\n\nNext:19. 98-19=79. Is 79 a prime? Let me think: 79 is not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11. The square root of 79 is about 8.9, so primes up to 7. Since 79 isn't divisible by any, it is prime. Yes!\n\nSo, 19 and 79 are primes that add up to 98. Therefore, 2, 19, and 79 add up to 100. Let me check: 2 + 19 = 21, 21 +79=100. Perfect.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, is there another triplet? Maybe. Let me check with other primes.\n\nContinuing from where I left: next prime is 23. 98 -23=75. 75 is divisible by 5, so not prime.\n\n29:98-29=69, which is divisible by 3.\n\n31:98-31=67. Is 67 a prime? Yes, 67 is a prime. So, 31 and 67 add up to 98. Therefore, triplet is 2,31,67. Let me add: 2 +31=33, 33+67=100.\n\nSo, that's another triplet. Okay, so there might be multiple solutions.\n\nWait, maybe there are more than two. Let me continue checking.\n\nNext prime:37. 98 -37=61. 61 is a prime. So, 2, 37, 61. Checking the sum: 2+37=39, 39+61=100. That's another triplet.\n\nNext:41. 98 -41=57."

        "output": "<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, okay. First off, what exactly are proper divisors? From what I remember, proper divisors of a number are all the positive integers that divide that number evenly, excluding the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list out all the numbers that divide it without leaving a remainder, except 36.\n\nAlright, let's start by figuring out what the proper divisors of 36 are. I think the best way is to list them systematically. Maybe starting from 1 and going up until half of 36.\n\nStarting with 1. Well, 1 divides every number, so that's definitely a proper divisor.\n\nNext, 2. Does 2 divide 36 evenly? Yes, because 36 divided by 2 is 18, which is an integer. So, 2 is a proper divisor.\n\n3. Hmm, 3 times 12 is 36, so yes, 3 is also a proper divisor.\n\n4. 4 times 9 is 36. Okay, 4 is a proper divisor.\n\n5. 5 doesn't divide into 36 evenly, right? 5 times 7 is 35, and 5 times 8 is 40, so it doesn't divide 36. So, 5 isn't a divisor.\n\n6. 6 times 6 is 36. Yes, so 6 is a proper divisor.\n\nWait, hold on, 6 squared is 36, so 6 is a divisor. Also, 7? Let me see, 7 times 5 is 35, 7 times 6 is 42, so no, 7 doesn't divide 36.\n\n8. 8 times 4.5 is 36, but we only consider integers, so 8 doesn't divide 36.\n\n9. 9 is 36 divided by 4, which is 9, so 9 is a proper divisor.\n\n10. 10 times 3.6 is 36, which isn't an integer. So, 10 isn't a divisor.\n\n11. 11 times something is 36? 11 times 3 is 33, 11 times 4 is 44, so no, 11 doesn't divide.\n\n12. 12 times 3 is 36. So, 12 is a proper divisor.\n\nWait, but if I go beyond 12, that's actually more than half of 36, which is 18. Since we're listing proper divisors, they should be less than 36. But after 12, the next number would be 18, but 18 is half of 36. Wait, is 18 considered a proper divisor or not? Hmm, the definition I know is that proper divisors exclude the number itself, so 18 would be a proper divisor because it's not equal to 36, right?\n\nWait, hold on, is 18 less than 36? Yes, so 18 is a proper divisor. Hmm, so maybe I stopped too early earlier.\n\nLet me rethink. A proper divisor is any divisor other than the number itself. So, starting from 1, and going up to 35, listing all divisors except 36. But that's a lot. Instead, maybe it's better to find all pairs of divisors that multiply to 36.\n\nSo, since 1 times 36 is 36, but 36 is not a proper divisor. Then, 2 times 18 is 36, so 2 and 18 are proper divisors.\n\n3 times 12 is 36, so 3 and 12 are proper.\n\n4 times 9 is 36, so 4 and 9 are proper.\n\n6 times 6 is 36, so 6 is repeated, but it's only counted once.\n\nSo, compiling these, the proper divisors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.\n\nLet me double-check if I missed any.\n\nStarting from 1: 1 x 36.\n\n2: 2 x 18.\n\n3: 3 x 12.\n\n4: 4 x 9.\n\n6: 6 x 6.\n\nYes, that's all. So, the proper divisors are indeed 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the sum of these numbers.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.\n\nAdding them one by one.\n\nStarting from 1.\n\n1 + 2 = 3.\n\n3 + 3 = 6.\n\n6"

        "output": "<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, okay. First, let me make sure I understand what a proper divisor is. If I recall correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 36 would be all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36. That makes sense.\n\nSo, to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I need to list out all the numbers that divide 36 and then add them up, excluding 36 itself. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a quicker way to do this without having to list them all out. Wait, I think there's something called the \"sum of divisors function\" which gives the sum of all divisors of a number, including the number itself. If that's the case, then maybe I can use that function and then subtract the number itself to get the sum of the proper divisors. Yeah, that sounds efficient.\n\nLet me recall how the sum of divisors function works. If a number is expressed in its prime factorization form, say \\( n = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\dots \\times p_k^{a_k} \\), then the sum of the divisors of n is given by the product of the sums of each prime power from 0 up to their exponent. So, in mathematical terms, it would be \\( (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\dots + p_1^{a_1}) \\times (1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\dots + p_2^{a_2}) \\times \\dots \\times (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \\dots + p_k^{a_k}) \\).\n\nOkay, so first, I need to factorize 36 into its prime factors. Let me do that. 36 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 36 by 2 gives me 18. 18 is also even, so dividing by 2 again gives me 9. Now, 9 is not even, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. Dividing 9 by 3 gives me 3, and dividing 3 by 3 gives me 1. So, the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3. In exponential form, that's \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\).\n\nGreat, so now I can apply the sum of divisors formula. For the prime factor 2 with exponent 2, the sum of its powers from 0 to 2 is \\( 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \\). For the prime factor 3 with exponent 2, the sum is \\( 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \\). So, multiplying these two sums together gives me the total sum of all divisors of 36, including 36 itself. That would be \\( 7 \\times 13 = 91 \\).\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the sum of all proper divisors, not including 36. So, I need to subtract 36 from this total. Let me do that: 91 minus 36 equals 55. Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 should be 55.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should list all the proper divisors of 36 and add them up to make sure I get 55. Let's see. The proper divisors of 36 are the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself. Starting from 1:\n\n1 is a divisor of every number, so that's 1.\n\n36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 and 18 are divisors. Wait, but since we're only listing proper divisors, 18 is a proper divisor.\n\n36 divided by 3 is 12, so 3 and 12 are proper divisors.\n\n36 divided by 4 is 9, so 4 and 9 are proper divisors.\n\n36 divided by 6 is 6, so 6 is a proper divisor, but since it's the square root, I think it's only counted once.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me list them systematically. Starting from 1 and moving up:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.\n\nIs that all? Let me check. 36 divided by 5 is 7"
