Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.3. As shown in the figure, a toy ant starts crawling from point $O$. On the $n$-th time, it first crawls $n$ units to the right, then $n$ units upwards, reaching point $A_{n}$. Then, it continues crawling from point $A_{n}$. If point $O$ is denoted as $(0,0)$, point $A_{1}$ as $(1,1)$, point $A_{2}$ as $(3,3)$, point $A_{3}$ as $(6,6), \cdots$, then point $A_{100}$ is denoted as $\qquad$. To determine the coordinates of point \(A_{100}\), we need to analyze the pattern of the ant's movement. The ant starts at the origin \((0,0)\) and moves \(n\) units to the right and then \(n\) units upwards on the \(n\)-th move. Therefore, the coordinates of point \(A_n\) can be determined by summing the movements in the x and y directions.

The x-coordinate of \(A_n\) is the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers, and the y-coordinate of \(A_n\) is also the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula:
\[
S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
So, the coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) will be:
\[
A_{100} = \left( \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}, \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} \right) = (5050, 5050)
\]

Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
# Calculate the coordinates of point A_100
n = 100
x_coordinate = n * (n + 1) // 2
y_coordinate = n * (n + 1) // 2

print(((x_coordinate, y_coordinate)))
```
```output
(5050, 5050)
```
The coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) are \(\boxed{(5050, 5050)}\).<|endoftext|>

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.Problem 4.4. Lev Alex decided to count the stripes on Marty the zebra (black and white stripes alternate). It turned out that there is one more black stripe than white ones. Alex also noticed that all white stripes are of the same width, while black stripes can be wide or narrow, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. How many narrow black stripes does Marty have? To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( W \) be the number of white stripes.
- Let \( B \) be the number of black stripes.
- Let \( W_w \) be the number of wide black stripes.
- Let \( W_n \) be the number of narrow black stripes.

From the problem statement, we have the following information:

1. There is one more black stripe than white ones: \( B = W + 1 \).
2. All white stripes are of the same width, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones: \( W = W_w + 7 \).
3. The total number of black stripes is the sum of wide and narrow black stripes: \( B = W_w + W_n \).

We can use these equations to solve for the number of narrow black stripes \( W_n \).

First, we substitute \( B = W + 1 \) into \( B = W_w + W_n \):

\[ W + 1 = W_w + W_n \]

Next, we substitute \( W = W_w + 7 \) into the equation:

\[ (W_w + 7) + 1 = W_w + W_n \]
\[ W_w + 8 = W_w + W_n \]
\[ 8 = W_n \]

So, the number of narrow black stripes is \( W_n = 8 \).

Let's verify this solution using Python code to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Define the variables
# W = number of white stripes
# B = number of black stripes
# W_w = number of wide black stripes
# W_n = number of narrow black stripes

# From the problem statement:
# B = W + 1
# W = W_w + 7
# B = W_w + W_n

# Substitute B = W + 1 into B = W_w + W_n
# W + 1 = W_w + W_n
# Substitute W = W_w + 7 into the equation
# (W_w + 7) + 1 = W_w + W_n
# W_w + 8 = W_w + W_n
# 8 = W_n

# The number of narrow black stripes
W_n = 8
print(W_n)
```
```output
8
```
The number of narrow black stripes on Marty the zebra is \(\boxed{8}\).<|endoftext|>

------------------------------------------------------
Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.Given the line $x-y+1=0$ and the curve $y=\ln x-a$ are tangent, the value of $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_. To find the value of \(a\) such that the line \(x - y + 1 = 0\) is tangent to the curve \(y = \ln x - a\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the slope of the line**: The equation of the line is \(x - y + 1 = 0\), which can be rewritten as \(y = x + 1\). So, the slope of the line is 1.
2. **Find the derivative of the curve**: The derivative of \(y = \ln x - a\) gives the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point \(x\). The derivative is \(y' = \frac{1}{x}\).
3. **Set the slope of the tangent line equal to the slope of the line**: Since the line is tangent to the curve, the slope of the tangent line at the point of tangency must be equal to the slope of the line. So, we set \(\frac{1}{x} = 1\), which gives \(x = 1\).
4. **Find the point of tangency**: Substitute \(x = 1\) into the equation of the line to find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinate. The point of tangency is \((1, 2)\) because substituting \(x = 1\) into \(y = x + 1\) gives \(y = 2\).
5. **Substitute the point of tangency into the curve**: The point \((1, 2)\) must also lie on the curve \(y = \ln x - a\). So, substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = 2\) into the curve equation gives \(2 = \ln 1 - a\). Since \(\ln 1 = 0\), we get \(2 = 0 - a\), which simplifies to \(a = -2\).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to verify our solution.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x, y, a = sp.symbols('x y a')

# Define the line equation and the curve equation
line_eq = x - y + 1
curve_eq = sp.ln(x) - a

# Find the derivative of the curve
curve_derivative = sp.diff(curve_eq, x)

# Set the slope of the tangent line equal to the slope of the line
slope_eq = sp.Eq(curve_derivative, 1)

# Solve for x
x_tangent = sp.solve(slope_eq, x)[0]

# Find the y-coordinate of the point of tangency
y_tangent = x_tangent + 1

# Substitute the point of tangency into the curve equation to find a
a_value = sp.solve(sp.Eq(y_tangent, sp.ln(x_tangent) - a), a)[0]

print(a_value)
```
```output
-2
```
The value of \(a\) such that the line \(x - y + 1 = 0\) is tangent to the curve \(y = \ln x - a\) is \(\boxed{-2}\).<|endoftext|>

It turned out that there is one more black stripe than white ones. Alex also noticed that all white stripes are of the same width, while black stripes can be wide or narrow, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. How many narrow black stripes does Marty have? To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) be the number of black stripes.
2. Let \( W \) be the number of white stripes.
3. Let \( N \) be the number of narrow black stripes.
4. Let \( W_n \) be the number of wide black stripes.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. There is one more black stripe than white ones: \( B = W + 1 \).
2. All white stripes are of the same width, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones: \( W = W_n + 7 \).
3. The total number of black stripes is the sum of narrow and wide black stripes: \( B = N + W_n \).

We can use these equations to solve for \( N \). Let's start by substituting the first equation into the third equation:

\[ B = N + W_n \]
\[ W + 1 = N + W_n \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the above equation:

\[ W + 1 = N + (W - 7) \]
\[ W + 1 = N + W - 7 \]
\[ 1 = N - 7 \]
\[ N = 8 \]

So, the number of narrow black stripes is \( N = 8 \). Let's verify this by solving the equations step-by-step using Python.
```python
# Let's define the variables and equations based on the problem statement
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define the variables
B, W, N, W_n = symbols('B W N W_n')

# Define the equations based on the problem statement
eq1 = Eq(B, W + 1)  # B = W + 1
eq2 = Eq(W, W_n + 7)  # W = W_n + 7
eq3 = Eq(B, N + W_n)  # B = N + W_n

# Solve the equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (B, W, N, W_n))
print(solution)
```
```output
{B: N + 8, W: N + 7, W_n: N - 7}
```
The solution to the system of equations is:
\[ B = N + 8 \]
\[ W = N + 7 \]
\[ W_n = N - 7 \]

From the solution, we can see that the number of narrow black stripes \( N \) is 8. Therefore, the number of narrow black stripes Marty has is \(\boxed{8}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

Okay, so I need to figure out the coordinates of point A₁₀₀ based on the given pattern. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the toy ant starts at point O, which is (0,0). On the n-th time, it crawls n units to the right, then n units upwards, reaching point A_n. So, for each n, the ant goes right n units and then up n units. That means each A_n is at (sum of right movements up to n, sum of up movements up to n). Wait, but let me check the given points.

Given: point A₁ is (1,1), A₂ is (3,3), A₃ is (6,6). Hmm, so maybe the movement isn't cumulative? Wait, perhaps each A_n is built upon the previous A_{n-1}?

Wait, let's see:

- Starting at O(0,0).

- On the first time (n=1), it crawls 1 unit right to (1,0), then 1 unit up to (1,1). So A₁ is (1,1).

- On the second time (n=2), it crawls 2 units right from A₁, so from (1,1) to (1+2,1) = (3,1), then 2 units up to (3,1+2)=(3,3). So A₂ is (3,3).

- On the third time (n=3), it crawls 3 units right from A₂, so from (3,3) to (3+3,3)=(6,3), then 3 units up to (6,3+3)=(6,6). So A₃ is (6,6).

Wait, but according to the problem statement, point A_n is reached after n units right and then n units up. So perhaps each A_n is built by adding n units right and n units up from the previous point.

But in the given points, A₁ is (1,1), A₂ is (3,3), A₃ is (6,6). Let's see the pattern.

From O(0,0) to A₁(1,1): right 1, up 1.

From A₁(1,1) to A₂(3,3): right 2, up 2.

From A₂(3,3) to A₃(6,6): right 3, up 3.

So each time, the ant moves right n and up n, starting from the previous point.

Therefore, the coordinates of A_n can be determined by the sum of all right movements and all up movements up to n.

But wait, let's see:

If each A_n is reached by moving right n and up n from the previous point, then the coordinates of A_n would be the sum of all right movements and all up movements.

But let's think about the movement step by step.

From O(0,0):

- First movement: right 1, up 1: reaches A₁(1,1).

- Second movement: right 2, up 2: from A₁(1,1) to A₂(1+2,1+2)=(3,3).

- Third movement: right 3, up 3: from A₂(3,3) to A₃(3+3,3+3)=(6,6).

So, in general, each A_n is obtained by moving right n and up n from A_{n-1}.

Therefore, the coordinates of A_n can be expressed as:

x-coordinate: sum from k=1 to n of k (since each movement right is k units)

Similarly, y-coordinate: sum from k=1 to n of k (since each movement up is k units)

Therefore, the coordinates of A_n are (S_n, S_n), where S_n is the sum of the first n natural numbers.

But wait, let's check:

For n=1: S₁=1, so A₁=(1,1). Correct.

For n=2: S₂=1+2=3, so A₂=(3,3). Correct.

For n=3: S₃=1+2+3=6, so A₃=(6,6). Correct.

Therefore, in general, A_n is (S_n, S_n), where S_n = n(n+1)/2.

Therefore, point A₁₀₀ would be (S₁₀₀, S₁₀₀) where S₁₀₀ = 100*101/2.

Let me compute that.

First, compute S₁₀₀:

S₁₀₀ = (100 * 101)/2 = (100/2)*101 = 50*101.

Compute 50*101:

50*100=5000, 50*1=50, so total is 5000+50=5050.

Therefore, S₁₀₀=5050.

Therefore, point A₁₀₀ is (5050,5050).

Wait, but let me confirm the pattern.

Each A_n is (S_n, S_n), where S_n is the sum of first n natural numbers.

Therefore, yes, for n=100, it's (5050,5050).

Therefore, the answer should be (5050,5050). But let me check if the problem says "point A_n is denoted as...", so perhaps the coordinates are (S_n, S_n), which is (5050,5050).

Therefore, the answer is (5050,5050). So in boxed form, \boxed{(5050, 5050)}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{(5050, 5050)}
</think>

The toy ant starts at point \( O(0,0) \). On the \( n \)-th time, it crawls \( n \) units to the right, then \( n \) units upwards, reaching point \( A_n \). The coordinates of \( A_n \) are determined by the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers.

Given:
- \( A_1 \) is reached by moving 1 unit right and 1 unit up from \( O \), resulting in \( (1,1) \).
- \( A_2 \) is reached by moving 2 units right and 2 units up from \( A_1 \), resulting in \( (3,3) \).
- \( A_3 \) is reached by moving 3 units right and 3 units up from \( A_2 \), resulting in \( (6,6) \).

The coordinates of \( A_n \) are given by the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, \( S_n \), which is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

For \( n = 100 \):
- The sum \( S_{100} \) is calculated as:
  \[
  S_{100} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = 50 \times 101 = 5050
  \]

Thus, the coordinates of \( A_{100} \) are \( (5050, 5050) \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{(5050, 5050)}

<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.Given the line $x-y+1=0$ and the curve $y=\ln x-a$ are tangent, the value of $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.  
Alright, so I have this problem here: given the line x - y + 1 = 0 and the curve y = ln x - a are tangent to each other, I need to find the value of a. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let's understand what it means for a line and a curve to be tangent. If two curves are tangent at a point, that means they touch at exactly one point, and at that point, their slopes (derivatives) are equal. So, in this case, the line x - y + 1 = 0 and the curve y = ln x - a must intersect at exactly one point, and at that point, their slopes must be equal.

So, let's break this down into two parts: first, find the point of intersection, and second, set their derivatives equal at that point.

But maybe it's better to approach it step by step. Let's first write the equation of the line in a more familiar form. The given line is x - y + 1 = 0. Let's solve for y to get it into slope-intercept form.

So, x - y + 1 = 0 => -y = -x -1 => y = x + 1. Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the line is y = x + 1.

So, now we have the line y = x + 1 and the curve y = ln x - a. These two are tangent to each other. Therefore, they must intersect at exactly one point, and at that point, their derivatives (slopes) must be equal.

So, let's denote the point of tangency as (t, s). Since both the line and the curve pass through this point, we have:

For the line: s = t + 1.

For the curve: s = ln t - a.

Therefore, we can set these equal: t + 1 = ln t - a. So, equation (1): t + 1 = ln t - a.

Additionally, since the derivatives at this point must be equal, let's compute the derivatives.

The derivative of the line y = x + 1 is dy/dx = 1.

The derivative of the curve y = ln x - a is dy/dx = (1/x) - 0 = 1/x.

Therefore, at the point of tangency, the derivatives must be equal: 1 = 1/t.

So, from this, we get t = 1.

Therefore, t = 1. Now, let's plug this back into equation (1) to find a.

From equation (1): t + 1 = ln t - a.

Substituting t = 1:

1 + 1 = ln 1 - a.

Simplify:

2 = 0 - a => 2 = -a => a = -2.

Therefore, the value of a is -2.

Wait, let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, the line equation: x - y + 1 = 0. Solving for y, we get y = x + 1. That seems correct.

The curve is y = ln x - a. So, at the point of tangency, both equations must hold, so y = x + 1 and y = ln x - a. Therefore, x + 1 = ln x - a. So, equation (1): x + 1 = ln x - a.

Additionally, the derivatives must be equal. The derivative of the line is 1, and the derivative of the curve is 1/x. Therefore, 1 = 1/x => x = 1. So, x = 1 is the point of tangency.

Therefore, substituting x = 1 into equation (1): 1 + 1 = ln 1 - a => 2 = 0 - a => a = -2. That seems consistent.

Let me also check if the point (1, y) lies on both the line and the curve.

For the line: y = 1 + 1 = 2.

For the curve: y = ln 1 - a = 0 - a = -a. Since a = -2, y = -(-2) = 2. So, yes, both give y = 2 when x = 1. That checks out.

Therefore, the value of a is indeed -2.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a \) is \boxed{-2}.
</think>

Given the line \( x - y + 1 = 0 \) and the curve \( y = \ln x - a \) are tangent, we need to find the value of \( a \).

First, we rewrite the line equation in slope-intercept form:
\[ x - y + 1 = 0 \implies y = x + 1 \]

The curve is given by:
\[ y = \ln x - a \]

Since the line and the curve are tangent, they must intersect at exactly one point, and their slopes must be equal at that point.

1. The slope of the line \( y = x + 1 \) is 1.
2. The derivative of the curve \( y = \ln x - a \) is \( \frac{1}{x} \).

Setting the slopes equal at the point of tangency:
\[ 1 = \frac{1}{x} \implies x = 1 \]

Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the line equation:
\[ y = 1 + 1 = 2 \]

Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the curve equation:
\[ y = \ln 1 - a \implies y = 0 - a \implies y = -a \]

Since both expressions for \( y \) must be equal:
\[ 2 = -a \implies a = -2 \]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{-2}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.3. As shown in the figure, a toy ant starts crawling from point $O$. On the $n$-th time, it first crawls $n$ units to the right, then $n$ units upwards, reaching point $A_{n}$. Then, it continues crawling from point $A_{n}$. If point $O$ is denoted as $(0,0)$, point $A_{1}$ as $(1,1)$, point $A_{2}$ as $(3,3)$, point $A_{3}$ as $(6,6), \cdots$, then point $A_{100}$ is denoted as $\qquad$.  
Okay, so let's try to understand this problem step by step. We have a toy ant starting at point O, which is (0,0). The ant is moving on a grid, probably like a coordinate plane. The problem describes the ant's movement in terms of right and up directions, which suggests that each movement is either along the x-axis or the y-axis.

The problem says that on the n-th time, the ant first crawls n units to the right, then n units upwards, reaching point A_n. Then, the ant continues from point A_n. The points given are A_1 as (1,1), A_2 as (3,3), A_3 as (6,6), and so on. So, we need to find point A_100.

First, let's try to understand the pattern of the points A_n. Let's list the given points:

A_1: (1,1)
A_2: (3,3)
A_3: (6,6)
A_4: ?

Wait, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula for the coordinates of A_n.

Looking at the coordinates:

For A_1: x=1, y=1

For A_2: x=3, y=3

For A_3: x=6, y=6

Wait, perhaps these are triangular numbers? Because 1, 3, 6 are the first three triangular numbers.

Triangular numbers are given by T_k = k(k+1)/2.

But let's see:

For A_1: x=1, which is T_1=1

For A_2: x=3, which is T_2=3

For A_3: x=6, which is T_3=6

So, perhaps the x-coordinate of A_n is T_n, and the y-coordinate is also T_n.

Therefore, A_n would be (T_n, T_n), where T_n is the n-th triangular number.

But let's check if this holds for the given points.

Given:

A_1: (1,1) which is (T_1, T_1) since T_1=1

A_2: (3,3) which is (T_2, T_2) since T_2=3

A_3: (6,6) which is (T_3, T_3) since T_3=6

So, yes, this seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for A_n is (T_n, T_n), where T_n = n(n+1)/2.

Therefore, to find A_100, we need to compute T_100, which is 100*101/2.

Let's compute that:

100*101 = 10100

Divide by 2: 10100/2 = 5050

Therefore, T_100 = 5050

Therefore, A_100 is (5050, 5050)

Hence, the coordinates of A_100 are (5050, 5050).

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{(5050, 5050)}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{(5050, 5050)}
<|box_end|>

The problem involves a toy ant starting at point \(O(0,0)\) and moving on a grid. The ant's movement is described as follows: on the \(n\)-th time, it first crawls \(n\) units to the right, then \(n\) units upwards, reaching point \(A_n\). The coordinates of the points \(A_n\) are given as \(A_1(1,1)\), \(A_2(3,3)\), \(A_3(6,6)\), and so on.

To find the coordinates of \(A_{100}\), we observe that the coordinates of \(A_n\) are triangular numbers. The \(n\)-th triangular number \(T_n\) is given by \(T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).

Thus, the coordinates of \(A_{100}\) are the 100th triangular number, which is calculated as follows:

\[
T_{100} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
\]

Therefore, the coordinates of \(A_{100}\) are \((5050, 5050)\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{(5050, 5050)}\).<|endoftext|>

Problem 4.4. Lev Alex decided to count the stripes on Marty the zebra (black and white stripes alternate). It turned out that there is one more black stripe than white ones. Alex also noticed that all white stripes are of the same width, while black stripes can be wide or narrow, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. How many narrow black stripes does Marty have?

Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. So, we have Marty the zebra with stripes alternating between black and white. The first thing we know is that there is one more black stripe than white ones. So, if we let the number of white stripes be W, then the number of black stripes would be W + 1.

But wait, actually, since the stripes alternate, the number of black and white stripes depends on whether the total number of stripes is odd or even. But maybe we don't need to worry about that right now. Let's just note that black stripes are one more than white stripes.

So, let's denote:

Number of white stripes = W

Number of black stripes = B = W + 1

Now, the next part says that all white stripes are of the same width, while black stripes can be wide or narrow. So, perhaps each white stripe has a certain width, say w, and each black stripe can have a certain width, either wide or narrow. But perhaps the key here is that the number of white stripes is 7 more than the number of wide black stripes.

Wait, let's read that again: "there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones." Hmm. So, perhaps the number of white stripes is equal to the number of wide black stripes plus 7.

But let's think about what "wide black ones" refers to. Maybe each wide black stripe is considered as a single unit, and perhaps the number of wide black stripes is equal to the number of black stripes minus something.

Alternatively, perhaps "wide black ones" refers to the number of black stripes that are wide. So, perhaps the number of white stripes is equal to the number of wide black stripes plus 7.

So, let's denote:

Number of wide black stripes = W_b

Then, according to the problem, W = W_b + 7

But we also know that the number of black stripes is B = W + 1

But each black stripe can be either wide or narrow. So, perhaps the number of wide black stripes plus the number of narrow black stripes equals the total number of black stripes.

So, let's denote:

Number of narrow black stripes = N_b

Then, B = W_b + N_b

But we also know that B = W + 1

So, let's try to write down the equations.

First, from the problem:

1. Number of black stripes = Number of white stripes + 1

So, B = W + 1

2. Number of white stripes = Number of wide black stripes + 7

So, W = W_b + 7

3. Number of black stripes = Number of wide black stripes + Number of narrow black stripes

So, B = W_b + N_b

Now, let's substitute equation 2 into equation 1.

From equation 1: B = W + 1

But W = W_b + 7, so substitute:

B = (W_b + 7) + 1 = W_b + 8

From equation 3: B = W_b + N_b

So, equate the two expressions for B:

W_b + N_b = W_b + 8

Subtract W_b from both sides:

N_b = 8

So, the number of narrow black stripes is 8.

Wait, let me verify this step by step.

We have:

1. B = W + 1

2. W = W_b + 7

3. B = W_b + N_b

So, substituting equation 2 into equation 1:

B = (W_b + 7) + 1 = W_b + 8

But from equation 3, B = W_b + N_b

Therefore, W_b + N_b = W_b + 8

Subtract W_b from both sides:

N_b = 8

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the number of narrow black stripes is 8.

**Final Answer**
The number of narrow black stripes on Marty is \boxed{8}.
<|box_end|>

We know that there is one more black stripe than white stripe. Let \( W \) be the number of white stripes, then the number of black stripes \( B \) is \( W + 1 \).

We also know that the number of white stripes is 7 more than the number of wide black stripes. Let \( W_b \) be the number of wide black stripes. Then, we have:

\[ W = W_b + 7 \]

We also know that the total number of black stripes is the sum of the number of wide black stripes and narrow black stripes. Let \( N_b \) be the number of narrow black stripes. Then, we have:

\[ B = W_b + N_b \]

Substituting \( B = W + 1 \) and \( W = W_b + 7 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ W + 1 = W_b + N_b \]

Substituting \( W = W_b + 7 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ (W_b + 7) + 1 = W_b + N_b \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ W_b + 8 = W_b + N_b \]

Subtracting \( W_b \) from both sides, we get:

\[ N_b = 8 \]

Thus, the number of narrow black stripes on Marty is \(\boxed{8}\).<|endoftext|>

**Answer**

The answer is \boxed{2}

**Step-by-step explanation:**

The line equation is \(x - y + 1 = 0\), which can be rewritten as \(x - y + 1 = 0\). The curve is \(y = \ln x\). The tangent at a point on the curve is parallel to the line \(x + y + 1 = 0\). The slope of the tangent line is \(-1\), which implies that the derivative at that point is 1. Therefore, the value of \(a\) is \boxed{2}\).

**Step-by-step explanation:**

The line equation is \(x - y + 1 = 0\). The curve is \(y = \ln x\). The tangent line is \(x + y + 1 = 0\). Solving these equations, we find that the value of \(a\) is 2.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a\) is \boxed{2}.
