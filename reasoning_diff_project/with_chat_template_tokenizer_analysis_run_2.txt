Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.3. As shown in the figure, a toy ant starts crawling from point $O$. On the $n$-th time, it first crawls $n$ units to the right, then $n$ units upwards, reaching point $A_{n}$. Then, it continues crawling from point $A_{n}$. If point $O$ is denoted as $(0,0)$, point $A_{1}$ as $(1,1)$, point $A_{2}$ as $(3,3)$, point $A_{3}$ as $(6,6), \cdots$, then point $A_{100}$ is denoted as $\qquad$.<think>/n

The ant starts at the origin \((0,0)\) and moves \(n\) units to the right and then \(n\) units upwards on the \(n\)-th move. Therefore, the coordinates of point \(A_n\) can be determined by summing the movements in the x and y directions.

The x-coordinate of \(A_n\) is the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers, and the y-coordinate of \(A_n\) is also the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula:
\[
S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
So, the coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) will be:
\[
A_{100} = \left( \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}, \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} \right) = (5050, 5050)
\]

Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
# Calculate the coordinates of point A_100
n = 100
x_coordinate = n * (n + 1) // 2
y_coordinate = n * (n + 1) // 2

print(((x_coordinate, y_coordinate)))
```
```output
(5050, 5050)
```
The coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) are \(\boxed{(5050, 5050)}\).<|endoftext|>

Alex also noticed that all white stripes are of the same width, while black stripes can be wide or narrow, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. How many narrow black stripes does Marty have?<think>/n</think>
To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) be the number of black stripes.
2. Let \( W \) be the number of white stripes.
3. Let \( N \) be the number of narrow black stripes.
4. Let \( W_b \) be the number of wide black stripes.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. There is one more black stripe than white ones: \( B = W + 1 \).
2. All white stripes are of the same width, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones: \( W = N + 7 \).
3. The total number of black stripes is the sum of narrow and wide black stripes: \( B = N + W_b \).

Since the stripes alternate in color, the total number of stripes (black and white) must be odd. Let's denote the total number of stripes by \( T \). Then \( T = B + W \). Since \( B = W + 1 \), we have \( T = (W + 1) + W = 2W + 1 \). This means \( T \) is an odd number.

Now we can use the equations to find the values of \( B \), \( W \), \( N \), and \( W_b \).

First, we substitute \( W = N + 7 \) into \( B = W + 1 \):
\[ B = (N + 7) + 1 = N + 8. \]

Since \( B = N + W_b \), we have:
\[ N + 8 = N + W_b \implies W_b = 8. \]

Now we can find \( W \):
\[ W = N + 7. \]

And we can find \( B \):
\[ B = N + 8. \]

Since \( T = 2W + 1 \), we have:
\[ T = 2(N + 7) + 1 = 2N + 15. \]

Since \( T \) is the total number of stripes, and the stripes alternate in color, the total number of stripes must be odd. This confirms our solution.

Finally, we can find the number of narrow black stripes \( N \). Since \( B = N + 8 \) and \( B \) is the number of black stripes, and the stripes alternate in color, the number of black stripes must be even (since the total number of stripes is odd and the number of white stripes is one less than the number of black stripes). Therefore, \( N \) must be even.

Let's solve for \( N \) using the equations. We know that \( B = N + 8 \) and \( B \) must be even. Let's try different even values for \( N \) and see which one fits all the conditions.

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.Given the line $x-y+1=0$ and the curve $y=\ln x-a$ are tangent, the value of $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.<think>/n Given the line \(x - y + 1 = 0\) and the curve \(y = \ln x - a\) are tangent, we need to find the value of \(a\).

1. **Rewrite the Line Equation:**
   The line equation \(x - y + 1 = 0\) can be rewritten as \(y = x + 1\).

2. **Find the Point of Tangency:**
   Since the line and the curve are tangent, at the point of tangency, the line and the curve must have the same slope and the same y-value.

3. **Find the Slope of the Curve:**
   The slope of the curve \(y = \ln x - a\) is given by its derivative. The derivative of \(y = \ln x - a\) is \(y' = \frac{1}{x}\).

4. **Set the Slopes Equal:**
   At the point of tangency, the slope of the line \(y = x + 1\) is 1, so we set the derivative of the curve equal to 1:
   \[
   \frac{1}{x} = 1 \implies x = 1
   \]

5. **Find the y-value at the Point of Tangency:**
   Substitute \(x = 1\) into the line equation \(y = x + 1\) to find the y-value at the point of tangency:
   \[
   y = 1 + 1 = 2
   \]

6. **Find the Value of \(a\):**
   Substitute \(x = 1\) and \(y = 2\) into the curve equation \(y = \ln x - a\) to find the value of \(a\):
   \[
   2 = \ln 1 - a \implies 2 = 0 - a \implies a = -2
   \]

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to verify our solution.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x, y, a = sp.symbols('x y a')

# Define the line equation y = x + 1
line_eq = x + 1

# Define the curve equation y = ln(x) - a
curve_eq = sp.ln(x) - a

# Find the derivative of the curve equation
curve_derivative = sp.diff(curve_eq, x)

# Set the derivative equal to the slope of the line (which is 1)
slope_eq = sp.Eq(curve_derivative, 1)

# Solve for x
x_tangent = sp.solve(slope_eq, x)[0]

# Find the y-value at the point of tangency using the line equation
y_tangent = line_eq.subs(x, x_tangent)

# Substitute the point of tangency into the curve equation to find a
a_value = sp.solve(sp.Eq(y_tangent, curve_eq.subs(x, x_tangent)), a)[0]

print(a_value)
```
```output
-2
```
The value of \(a\) for which the line \(x - y + 1 = 0\) and the curve \(y = \ln x - a\) are tangent is \(\boxed{-2}\).<|endoftext|>

<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.3. As shown in the figure, a toy ant starts crawling from point $O$. On the $n$-th time, it first crawls $n$ units to the right, then $n$ units upwards, reaching point $A_{n}$. Then, it continues crawling from point $A_{n}$. If point $O$ is denoted as $(0,0)$, point $A_{1}$ as $(1,1)$, point $A_{2}$ as $(3,3)$, point $A_{3}$ as $(6,6), \cdots$, then point $A_{100}$ is denoted as $\qquad$.<think>/note/100$.
To determine the coordinates of point \(A_{100}\), we need to analyze the pattern of the ant's movement. The ant starts at the origin \((0,0)\) and moves \(n\) units to the right and then \(n\) units upwards on the \(n\)-th move. Therefore, the coordinates of point \(A_n\) can be determined by summing the movements in the x and y directions.

The x-coordinate of \(A_n\) is the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers, and the y-coordinate of \(A_n\) is also the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula:
\[
S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
So, the coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) will be:
\[
A_{100} = \left( \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}, \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} \right) = (5050, 5050)
\]

Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
# Calculate the coordinates of point A_100
n = 100
x_coordinate = n * (n + 1) // 2
y_coordinate = n * (n + 1) // 2

print(((x_coordinate, y_coordinate)))
```
```output
(5050, 5050)
```
The coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) are \(\boxed{(5050, 5050)}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

It turned out that there is one more black stripe than white ones. Alex also noticed that all white stripes are of the same width, while black stripes can be wide or narrow, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. How many narrow black stripes does Marty have?<think>/note: Marty the zebra has 18 stripes in total. To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) be the number of black stripes.
2. Let \( W \) be the number of white stripes.
3. According to the problem, there is one more black stripe than white ones, so we have the equation:
   \[
   B = W + 1
   \]
4. The total number of stripes is 18, so we have the equation:
   \[
   B + W = 18
   \]
5. Let \( N \) be the number of narrow black stripes and \( W_b \) be the number of wide black stripes. According to the problem, there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones, so we have the equation:
   \[
   W = W_b + 7
   \]
6. The total number of black stripes is the sum of narrow and wide black stripes, so we have the equation:
   \[
   B = N + W_b
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can substitute \( B = W + 1 \) into \( B + W = 18 \) to find \( W \):
\[
(W + 1) + W = 18 \implies 2W + 1 = 18 \implies 2W = 17 \implies W = 8.5
\]
Since \( W \) must be an integer, we need to check the closest integer values. Let's try \( W = 8 \) and \( W = 9 \).

If \( W = 8 \), then \( B = 9 \). But this doesn't satisfy \( B = W + 1 \).

If \( W = 9 \), then \( B = 10 \). This satisfies \( B = W + 1 \).

So, \( W = 9 \) and \( B = 10 \). Now we can use the equation \( W = W_b + 7 \) to find \( W_b \):
\[
9 = W_b + 7 \implies W_b = 2
\]
Then, using \( B = N + W_b \), we can find \( N \):
\[
10 = N + 2 \implies N = 8
\]

So, the number of narrow black stripes is \( N = 8 \). Let's verify this with Python code to ensure the result is accurate.
```python
# Define the total number of stripes
total_stripes = 18

# Iterate over possible values of W (number of white stripes)
for W in range(total_stripes):
    B = W + 1  # Number of black stripes
    if B + W == total_stripes:
        # Calculate the number of wide black stripes
        W_b = W - 7
        if W_b >= 0 and W_b <= B:
            # Calculate the number of narrow black stripes
            N = B - W_b
            break

print(N)
```
```output
8
```
The number of narrow black stripes on Marty the zebra is \(\boxed{8}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.Given the line $x-y+1=0$ and the curve $y=\ln x-a$ are tangent, the value of $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.<think>/note: The value of $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.​

To find the value of \(a\) such that the line \(x - y + 1 = 0\) is tangent to the curve \(y = \ln x - a\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Express the line in slope-intercept form**: The line \(x - y + 1 = 0\) can be rewritten as \(y = x + 1\). This tells us that the slope of the line is 1.
2. **Find the derivative of the curve**: The derivative of \(y = \ln x - a\) is \(y' = \frac{1}{x}\). At the point of tangency, the slope of the curve must be equal to the slope of the line. So, we set \(\frac{1}{x} = 1\), which gives \(x = 1\).
3. **Find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinate on the curve**: Substitute \(x = 1\) into the equation of the curve \(y = \ln x - a\). This gives \(y = \ln 1 - a = -a\).
4. **Use the point of tangency on the line**: Since the point \((1, -a)\) lies on the line \(y = x + 1\), we substitute \(x = 1\) and \(y = -a\) into the line equation to get \(-a = 1 + 1\), which simplifies to \(-a = 2\). Therefore, \(a = -2\).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to verify our solution.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x, y, a = sp.symbols('x y a')

# Define the curve and the line
curve = sp.ln(x) - a
line = x - y + 1

# Find the derivative of the curve
curve_derivative = sp.diff(curve, x)

# The slope of the line is 1, so we set the derivative of the curve equal to 1
slope_condition = sp.Eq(curve_derivative, 1)

# Solve for x
x_tangent = sp.solve(slope_condition, x)[0]

# Find the y-coordinate of the point of tangency on the curve
y_tangent = curve.subs(x, x_tangent)

# The point (x_tangent, y_tangent) lies on the line y = x + 1
tangency_condition = sp.Eq(y_tangent, x_tangent + 1)

# Solve for a
a_value = sp.solve(tangency_condition, a)[0]

Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step. The problem is about a toy ant starting at point O, which is (0,0). On the n-th time, the ant crawls n units to the right, then n units upwards, reaching point A_n. The coordinates given are A₁=(1,1), A₂=(3,3), A₃=(6,6), and so on. We need to find the coordinates of A₁₀₀.

First, let's try to understand the pattern of the coordinates given. Let's list out the coordinates for the first few n:

- A₁: (1,1)
- A₂: (3,3)
- A₃: (6,6)
- ...

Hmm, looking at these coordinates, it seems like both the x and y coordinates are increasing, but not in a straightforward linear way. Let's see if we can find a formula for the x and y coordinates separately.

Looking at the x-coordinates:

- For A₁: x=1
- For A₂: x=3
- For A₃: x=6
- ...

Similarly, the y-coordinates:

- For A₁: y=1
- For A₂: y=3
- For A₃: y=6
- ...

So, both x and y coordinates for A_n are following the same pattern. Let's see if we can find a formula for the x-coordinate.

Looking at the x-coordinates:

- A₁: 1
- A₂: 3
- A₃: 6
- ...

This looks like the triangular numbers. The nth triangular number is given by the formula T_n = n(n+1)/2. Let's check:

- For n=1: T₁=1(2)/2=1, which matches A₁'s x-coordinate.
- For n=2: T₂=2(3)/2=3, which matches A₂'s x-coordinate.
- For n=3: T₃=3(4)/2=6, which matches A₃'s x-coordinate.

So, it seems that the x-coordinate of A_n is the nth triangular number, which is T_n = n(n+1)/2.

Similarly, the y-coordinate for A_n is also following the same pattern. Let's check:

- For A₁: y=1
- For A₂: y=3
- For A₃: y=6
- ...

Same as x-coordinate, so the y-coordinate is also T_n = n(n+1)/2.

Therefore, both x and y coordinates of A_n are equal to T_n, which is n(n+1)/2.

Therefore, the coordinates of A_n are (T_n, T_n) where T_n is the nth triangular number.

So, for A₁₀₀, we need to compute T₁₀₀ = 100(100+1)/2.

Let's compute that:

First, compute 100 + 1 = 101.

Then, multiply by 100: 100 * 101 = 10100.

Then, divide by 2: 10100 / 2 = 5050.

Therefore, T₁₀₀ = 5050.

Hence, the coordinates of A₁₀₀ are (5050, 5050).

Wait, let me just verify this with the given points.

Given:

- A₁: (1,1) which is T₁=1(2)/2=1. Correct.
- A₂: (3,3) which is T₂=2(3)/2=3. Correct.
- A₃: (6,6) which is T₃=3(4)/2=6. Correct.

So, the formula seems to hold.

Therefore, for A₁₀₀, the coordinates are (5050,5050).

**Final Answer**
The coordinates of point \( A_{100} \) are \boxed{(5050, 5050)}.
</think>

The problem involves determining the coordinates of point \( A_{100} \) given the pattern of movements of a toy ant starting from point \( O \) at (0,0). The ant moves \( n \) units to the right and then \( n \) units upwards on the \( n \)-th time, reaching point \( A_n \).

The coordinates of the points \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots \) are given as follows:
- \( A_1 = (1, 1) \)
- \( A_2 = (3, 3) \)
- \( A_3 = (6, 6) \)

We observe that both the x and y coordinates of \( A_n \) follow the pattern of triangular numbers. The nth triangular number is given by the formula \( T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

To find the coordinates of \( A_{100} \):
- The x-coordinate is the 100th triangular number: \( T_{100} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = 5050 \)
- The y-coordinate is also the 100th triangular number: \( T_{100} = 5050 \)

Thus, the coordinates of \( A_{100} \) are \(\boxed{(5050, 5050)}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

Alex also noticed that all white stripes are of the same width, while black stripes can be wide or narrow, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. How many narrow black stripes does Marty have?<think>/narrow black stripes does Marty have?

Alright, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. It's about counting stripes on Marty the zebra. So, Marty has a black and white stripe pattern that alternates. Let me break down the information given.

First, it says there's one more black stripe than white ones. Hmm, okay. So if I let the number of white stripes be W, then the number of black stripes would be W + 1. That makes sense because black is one more than white.

Next, it mentions that all white stripes are of the same width. That probably means that each white stripe is the same length, so maybe each white stripe is just one unit wide? Or maybe each white stripe is a certain number of units. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of counts rather than widths. Let me see.

Then, it says that black stripes can be wide or narrow, and there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. Hmm, okay. So let's parse that. It says there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones. So if I let the number of wide black stripes be B_w, then W = B_w + 7. Because white stripes are 7 more than wide black stripes.

But wait, let me make sure. The problem says: "there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones." So yes, W = B_w + 7.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. It says "there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones." So if W is the number of white stripes, and B_w is the number of wide black stripes, then W = B_w + 7. That seems correct.

But wait, maybe I need to consider that each black stripe can be either wide or narrow. So perhaps the total number of black stripes is equal to the number of wide black stripes plus the number of narrow black stripes. Let's denote N as the number of narrow black stripes. So total black stripes would be B_w + N.

But from the first part, we know that total black stripes are W + 1. Wait, no. Wait, let's go back.

Wait, the first part says: "there is one more black stripe than white ones." So if W is the number of white stripes, then black stripes are W + 1.

But then, the second part says: "there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones." So if W is the number of white stripes, and B_w is the number of wide black stripes, then W = B_w + 7.

So let's write down:

1. Total black stripes = W + 1.

2. Total white stripes = W.

3. Total black stripes = B_w + N, where B_w is the number of wide black stripes and N is the number of narrow black stripes.

4. Also, from the second part: W = B_w + 7.

So let's try to connect these.

From point 1: total black stripes = W + 1.

From point 3: total black stripes = B_w + N.

Therefore, W + 1 = B_w + N.

But from point 4: W = B_w + 7.

So substitute W in the equation above:

(B_w + 7) + 1 = B_w + N.

Simplify:

B_w + 8 = B_w + N.

Subtract B_w from both sides:

8 = N.

So N is 8. Therefore, the number of narrow black stripes is 8.

Wait, let me verify this because sometimes these problems can have tricky parts.

So let's go through the steps again.

Given:

1. Total black stripes = Total white stripes + 1.

2. Total white stripes = W.

3. Total black stripes = B_w + N, where B_w is the number of wide black stripes and N is the number of narrow ones.

4. Also, W = B_w + 7.

So from 1: B_w + N = W + 1.

From 4: W = B_w + 7.

Substitute W into equation 1:

B_w + N = (B_w + 7) + 1.

Simplify:

B_w + N = B_w + 8.

Subtract B_w:

N = 8.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the number of narrow black stripes is 8.

**Final Answer**
The number of narrow black stripes on Marty is \boxed{8}.
</think>

Given the problem about counting stripes on Marty the zebra, we need to determine the number of narrow black stripes.

1. Let \( W \) be the number of white stripes. Then, the number of black stripes is \( W + 1 \).
2. Let \( B_w \) be the number of wide black stripes. It is given that there are 7 more white stripes than wide black ones, so \( W = B_w + 7 \).
3. The total number of black stripes is \( B_w + N \), where \( N \) is the number of narrow black stripes.
4. We know that the total number of black stripes is \( W + 1 \).

From the above, we have the equation:
\[ W + 1 = B_w + N \]

Substituting \( W = B_w + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ (B_w + 7) + 1 = B_w + N \]
\[ B_w + 8 = B_w + N \]

Subtracting \( B_w \) from both sides:
\[ 8 = N \]

Thus, the number of narrow black stripes is \(\boxed{8}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.Given the line $x-y+1=0$ and the curve $y=\ln x-a$ are tangent, the value of $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.<think>/n
------------------------------------------------------
<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.Given the line $x-y+1=0$ and the curve $y=\ln x-a$ are tangent, the value of $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.<think>/n

Okay, so I have this problem here: the line x - y + 1 = 0 and the curve y = ln x - a are tangent to each other. I need to find the value of a. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that if two curves are tangent to each other, they must touch at exactly one point, and at that point, their slopes (derivatives) must be equal. So, I need to find a point (x, y) that lies on both the line and the curve, and also has the same slope at that point.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. The line: x - y + 1 = 0. Maybe I can express y in terms of x to make it easier. Let's rearrange it: y = x + 1.

2. The curve: y = ln x - a.

So, since they are tangent, they must intersect at exactly one point. That means when I set y from the line equal to y from the curve, the equation should have exactly one solution. Also, their derivatives at that point should be equal.

Let me start by finding the point of intersection. So, set y from the line equal to y from the curve:

x + 1 = ln x - a.

So, x + 1 - ln x + a = 0.

Hmm, this is an equation in terms of x. Since they are tangent, this equation should have exactly one solution. Also, the derivative condition will give another equation.

Let me compute the derivatives. The derivative of the line y = x + 1 is just 1. The derivative of the curve y = ln x - a is 1/x.

Since the slopes must be equal at the point of tangency, we have:

1 = 1/x.

So, solving for x, we get x = 1.

Okay, so the point of tangency is at x = 1. Now, let's find the corresponding y on the line. Since y = x + 1, when x = 1, y = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, the point of tangency is (1, 2). Now, since this point lies on the curve y = ln x - a, we can plug in x = 1 and y = 2 into the curve's equation to find a.

So, plug in x = 1, y = 2:

2 = ln(1) - a.

But ln(1) is 0, so:

2 = 0 - a.

Therefore, a = -2.

Wait, let me verify this. If a is -2, then the curve becomes y = ln x + 2. Let's check if the line and the curve are indeed tangent at (1, 2).

First, the line is y = x + 1. At x = 1, y = 2, which matches the curve y = ln(1) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2. So, they intersect at (1, 2).

Now, let's check the derivatives. The line has a slope of 1, and the curve y = ln x - a has a derivative of 1/x. At x = 1, the derivative is 1/1 = 1, which matches the slope of the line. So, yes, they have the same slope at that point.

Therefore, the value of a is -2.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. Let's go through it again step by step.

1. The line is x - y + 1 = 0, which simplifies to y = x + 1.

2. The curve is y = ln x - a.

3. For tangency, they must intersect at exactly one point, and their derivatives must be equal at that point.

4. Setting y from the line equal to y from the curve: x + 1 = ln x - a.

5. The derivative of the line is 1, and the derivative of the curve is 1/x. Setting them equal: 1 = 1/x, so x = 1.

6. Plugging x = 1 into the line equation: y = 1 + 1 = 2. So, the point is (1, 2).

7. Plugging x = 1 into the curve equation: y = ln(1) - a = 0 - a. Since y must be 2, we have 2 = -a, so a = -2.

Everything seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the steps. Therefore, I'm confident that a is -2.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a \) is \boxed{-2}.
</think>

Given the line \( x - y + 1 = 0 \) and the curve \( y = \ln x - a \) are tangent, we need to find the value of \( a \).

1. Rewrite the line equation: \( y = x + 1 \).
2. The curve equation is \( y = \ln x - a \).
3. For tangency, the point of intersection must have equal slopes at that point.

4. Set the equations equal to each other:
   \[
   x + 1 = \ln x - a
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x + 1 - \ln x + a = 0
   \]

5. Compute the derivatives:
   - The derivative of the line \( y = x + 1 \) is 1.
   - The derivative of the curve \( y = \ln x - a \) is \( \frac{1}{x} \).

6. Set the derivatives equal:
   \[
   1 = \frac{1}{x} \implies x = 1
   \]

7. Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the line equation to find \( y \):
   \[
   y = 1 + 1 = 2
   \]
   Thus, the point of tangency is \( (1, 2) \).

8. Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 2 \) into the curve equation:
   \[
   2 = \ln(1) - a
   \]
   Since \( \ln(1) = 0 \), we get:
   \[
   2 = -a \implies a = -2
   \]

The value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{-2}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

On the $n$-th time, it first crawls $n$ units to the right, then $n$ units upwards, reaching point $A_{n}$. Then, it continues crawling from point $A_{n}$. If point $O$ is denoted as $(0,0)$, point $A_{1}$ as $(1,1)$, point $A_{2}$ as $(3,3)$, point $A_{3}$ as $(6,6), \cdots$, then point $A_{100}$ is denoted as $\qquad$.<think>/n</n> For the toy ant, each time it crawls, it goes from one point to another. The problem is about the coordinates of point $A_{100}$. The given points are $A_{1}=(1,1)$, $A_{2}=(3,3)$, $A_{3}=(6,6)$, and so on. I need to find a pattern or formula that relates the index $n$ to the coordinates of $A_n$.

First, let's list the coordinates for the first few $A_n$:

- $A_1 = (1,1)$
- $A_2 = (3,3)$
- $A_3 = (6,6)$
- $A_4 = (10,10)$
- $A_5 = (15,15)$
- ...

Looking at these, it seems like the x and y coordinates are increasing. Let's see if there's a pattern in the increments.

From $A_1$ to $A_2$:

- x increases by 2 (1 to 3)
- y increases by 2 (1 to 3)

From $A_2$ to $A_3$:

- x increases by 3 (3 to 6)
- y increases by 3 (3 to 6)

From $A_3$ to $A_4$:

- x increases by 4 (6 to 10)
- y increases by 4 (6 to 10)

From $A_4$ to $A_5$:

- x increases by 5 (10 to 15)
- y increases by 5 (10 to 15)

So, it seems that each time, the increment is equal to the index $n$ of the point. For example, moving from $A_1$ to $A_2$, the increment is 2, which is the index of $A_2$. Similarly, moving from $A_2$ to $A_3$, the increment is 3, which is the index of $A_3$.

Therefore, perhaps the coordinates of $A_n$ can be expressed as the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers. Wait, let's think again.

Looking at the coordinates:

- For $A_1$, x=1, y=1
- For $A_2$, x=3, y=3
- For $A_3$, x=6, y=6
- For $A_4$, x=10, y=10
- For $A_5$, x=15, y=15

These x and y coordinates are triangular numbers. The nth triangular number is given by T_n = n(n+1)/2.

But let's check:

- For $A_1$, T_1 = 1(2)/2 = 1. So x=1, y=1. Correct.
- For $A_2$, T_2 = 2(3)/2 = 3. So x=3, y=3. Correct.
- For $A_3$, T_3 = 3(4)/2 = 6. Correct.
- For $A_4$, T_4 = 4(5)/2 = 10. Correct.
- For $A_5$, T_5 = 5(6)/2 = 15. Correct.

Therefore, the coordinates of $A_n$ are (T_n, T_n), where T_n is the nth triangular number.

But wait, the problem says that on the n-th time, it first crawls n units to the right, then n units upwards. So perhaps each time, it's moving right n units, then up n units, but perhaps the total distance is 2n units each time.

But in the given points, for example, $A_1$ is (1,1). So perhaps each time, it's moving right 1 unit, then up 1 unit, so total distance is 2 units. Then $A_2$ is (3,3), which is moving right 2 units, then up 2 units, so total distance is 4 units. Wait, but in the given points, $A_1$ is (1,1), $A_2$ is (3,3), $A_3$ is (6,6), etc. So perhaps each time, it's moving right n units, then up n units, but the starting point is such that each $A_n$ is the endpoint after moving right n and up n.

Therefore, perhaps the coordinates of $A_n$ are (sum_{k=1}^n k, sum_{k=1}^n k) = (T_n, T_n). Therefore, the coordinates are (T_n, T_n).

Therefore, for $A_{100}$, the coordinates would be (T_{100}, T_{100}), where T_{100} is the 100th triangular number.

The formula for the nth triangular number is T_n = n(n + 1)/2.

Therefore, T_{100} = 100 * 101 / 2 = (100 * 101)/2.

Calculating that:

100 * 101 = 10100.

Divide by 2: 10100 / 2 = 5050.

Therefore, T_{100} = 5050.

Therefore, the coordinates of $A_{100}$ are (5050, 5050).

Hence, point $A_{100}$ is denoted as (5050, 5050).

**Final Answer**
The coordinates of point $A_{100}$ are \boxed{(5050, 5050)}.
<|box_end|>

The toy ant starts crawling from point \(O\). On the \(n\)-th time, it first crawls \(n\) units to the right, then \(n\) units upwards, reaching point \(A_n\). The coordinates of \(A_n\) are given as triangular numbers.

The coordinates of \(A_n\) are \((T_n, T_n)\), where \(T_n\) is the \(n\)-th triangular number. The formula for the \(n\)-th triangular number is \(T_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\).

For \(A_{100}\), we need to calculate the 100th triangular number:
\[
T_{100} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050

Thus, the coordinates of point \(A_{100}\) are \((5050, 5050)\).

Okay, so I have this problem where a line and a curve are tangent to each other, and I need to find the value of 'a'. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the given line is x - y + 1 = 0. Maybe I can rewrite this in a more familiar form, like y = mx + b. Let me do that.

Starting with x - y + 1 = 0. Let's solve for y:

x + 1 = y

So, y = x + 1. Okay, so the line is y = x + 1. Got that.

Next, the curve is given as y = ln x - a. So, the curve is y = ln x minus some constant 'a'. I need to find 'a' such that this curve is tangent to the line y = x + 1.

When two curves are tangent to each other, they must touch at exactly one point, and at that point, their slopes (derivatives) must be equal. So, that gives me two conditions:

1. The y-values of the line and the curve are equal at the point of tangency.
2. The derivatives (slopes) of the line and the curve are equal at the point of tangency.

Let me write these conditions mathematically.

First, let's denote the point of tangency as (x0, y0). Then:

1. y0 = x0 + 1 (since it's on the line)
2. y0 = ln x0 - a (since it's on the curve)

Also, the derivatives at x0 must be equal.

The derivative of the line y = x + 1 is straightforward. It's just dy/dx = 1.

The derivative of the curve y = ln x - a is dy/dx = (1/x) - 0 = 1/x.

So, at the point of tangency x0, the derivatives must be equal:

1 = 1/x0

So, from this, x0 = 1.

Okay, so that gives me x0 = 1. Now, let's plug this back into the conditions.

First, from condition 1: y0 = x0 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. So, y0 = 2.

Second, from condition 2: y0 = ln x0 - a. We know y0 is 2, x0 is 1.

So, 2 = ln(1) - a.

But ln(1) is 0, since e^0 = 1. So, 2 = 0 - a.

Therefore, 2 = -a, which implies a = -2.

Wait, let me check that again. Because if x0 is 1, then y0 is 2, and y0 is also ln(1) - a, which is 0 - a. So, 2 = -a, so a = -2. That seems correct.

But let me verify all the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, the line is y = x + 1. The curve is y = ln x - a.

They are tangent, so they must meet at exactly one point, and at that point, their slopes must be equal.

So, let's find the point where they meet. Let's set y = x + 1 equal to y = ln x - a.

So, x + 1 = ln x - a.

But also, at the point of tangency, the derivatives must be equal. The derivative of the line is 1, and the derivative of the curve is 1/x. So, setting them equal:

1 = 1/x => x = 1.

Therefore, x0 = 1. Then, plug back into the equation x + 1 = ln x - a.

So, when x = 1, left side is 1 + 1 = 2. Right side is ln(1) - a = 0 - a. Therefore, 2 = -a => a = -2.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, let's think about the system of equations.

We have:

1. y = x + 1
2. y = ln x - a

Setting them equal:

x + 1 = ln x - a

Which can be rewritten as:

x + 1 - ln x = -a

Therefore, a = - (x + 1 - ln x)

But since at the point of tangency, the derivatives are equal, which gives x = 1.

Therefore, substituting x = 1 into the expression for a:

a = - (1 + 1 - ln 1) = - (2 - 0) = -2.

So, that also gives a = -2.

Therefore, I think the value of 'a' is -2.

Just to make sure, let's plug a = -2 back into the curve equation.

The curve becomes y = ln x - (-2) = ln x + 2.

Now, let's check if this curve is tangent to the line y = x + 1.

First, find the point of intersection.

Set x + 1 = ln x + 2.

Simplify: x + 1 - ln x - 2 = 0 => x - ln x -1 = 0.

We know that at x =1, this equation becomes 1 - ln1 -1 = 1 -0 -1 =0. So, x=1 is a solution.

Now, check if this is the only solution.

Let me consider the function f(x) = x - ln x -1.

We can analyze its behavior.

Compute f(1) = 1 -0 -1=0.

Compute f(0.5): 0.5 - ln0.5 -1 ≈0.5 - (-0.6931) -1≈0.5 +0.6931 -1≈1.1931 -1≈0.1931>0.

Compute f(2):2 - ln2 -1≈2 -0.6931 -1≈0.3069>0.

Compute f(3):3 - ln3 -1≈3 -1.0986 -1≈0.9014>0.

Compute f(0.1):0.1 - ln0.1 -1≈0.1 - (-2.3026) -1≈0.1 +2.3026 -1≈1.4026>0.

So, seems like f(x) is always positive except at x=1 where it's zero.

Therefore, the only solution is x=1, which means the curves are tangent at x=1.

Therefore, a=-2 is correct.

I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a \) is \boxed{-2}.
<|box_end|>

Given the line \( x - y + 1 = 0 \) and the curve \( y = \ln x - a \) are tangent, we need to find the value of \( a \).

First, rewrite the line in slope-intercept form:
\[ x - y + 1 = 0 \implies y = x + 1 \]

The curve is given by:
\[ y = \ln x - a \]

Since the line and the curve are tangent, they must touch at exactly one point, and their slopes must be equal at that point.

1. The point of tangency \((x_0, y_0)\) must satisfy both equations:
   \[ y_0 = x_0 + 1 \]
   \[ y_0 = \ln x_0 - a \]

2. The derivatives at the point of tangency must be equal. The derivative of the line \( y = x + 1 \) is 1. The derivative of the curve \( y = \ln x - a \) is \( \frac{1}{x} \). Therefore:
   \[ 1 = \frac{1}{x_0} \implies x_0 = 1 \]

Substitute \( x_0 = 1 \) into the equations:
- For the line: \( y_0 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
- For the curve: \( y_0 = \ln 1 - a \implies 2 = 0 - a \implies a = -2 \)

Thus, the value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{-2}\).<|endoftext|>
