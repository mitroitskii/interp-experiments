Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability questions like this usually involve combinations and some sort of favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes. 

First, let's consider the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Each die has 6 sides, so for five dice, it should be 6 multiplied by itself five times, right? So, 6^5. Let me calculate that:

6^5 = 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6. Hmm, 6×6 is 36, 36×6 is 216, 216×6 is 1296, and 1296×6 is 7776. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice. That seems right.

Now, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one of the five dice shows a 6. So, to clarify, out of the five dice, one die should show a 6, and the other four should show something else, but not 6. Got it.

I remember that this type of problem is a typical application of the binomial probability formula. The binomial formula is used when there are exactly two mutually exclusive outcomes (like success and failure) in each trial, which is the case here because when we roll a die, the outcome is either a 6 or not a 6. So, in this case, the number of ways to get exactly one 6 can be calculated by choosing which one of the five dice shows the 6, and then the other dice show something else.

So, the first thing I need to figure out is how many ways I can choose which die shows the 6. Since there are five dice, the number of ways to choose one die is the combination of five dice taken one at a time, which is denoted as C(5,1). 

Calculating C(5,1). The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where "n!" stands for n factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to n. So, plugging in the numbers:

C(5,1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (1 × (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)). Let me compute that step by step. 

5! is 120, and 4! is 24. So, 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which die shows the 6.

Once we have chosen which die is the 6, the remaining four dice need to show something that is not a 6. Each of these four dice has 5 possible outcomes (since they can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Therefore, for each of these four dice, there are 5 choices. 

So, the number of favorable outcomes for the remaining four dice is 5^4. Let me calculate that: 5 × 5 × 5 × 5. That's 25 × 25 = 625. So, 5^4 is 625.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6 is the product of the number of ways to choose the die that shows 6 and the number of possible outcomes for the remaining four dice. So, that would be C(5,1) multiplied by 5^4, which is 5 × 625.

Calculating that, 5 × 625 = 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes.

Wait a minute, is that correct? Let me think again. So, for each die, the chance of rolling a 6 is 1/6, and the chance of rolling not a 6 is 5/6. Since we're dealing with exactly one 6, this should fit the binomial probability formula, which is C(n, k) × p^k × (1 - p)^(n - k).

Applying that, n is 5, k is 1, p is 1/6.

So, substituting in:

C(5,1) × (1/6)^1 × (5/6)^(5 - 1) = 5 × (1/6) × (5/6)^4.

Hmm, let me compute that. (5/6)^4 is (625 / 1296). So, putting it all together:

5 × (1/6) × (625 / 1296). Let's calculate step by step

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability questions like this usually involve combinations and some sort of probability multiplication. Let me break it down step by step.

First off, when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? So, for each die, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 6 is 5/6. That seems straightforward.

Now, the problem is about rolling five dice and getting exactly one 6. So, I need to consider all the possible ways this can happen. I think this is a binomial probability problem because each die roll is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: success (rolling a 6) or failure (not rolling a 6). 

In binomial terms, the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by the formula:

P(k) = C(n, k) * (p)^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. So, in this case, n is 5 (since we're rolling five dice), k is 1 (we want exactly one 6), p is 1/6, and 1-p is 5/6.

Let me write that down:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Okay, now I need to calculate each part of this equation. First, let's compute C(5, 1). The combination formula is:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

Where "!" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, C(5, 1) is 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1). Wait, that simplifies to 5 / 1, which is 5. So, C(5, 1) is 5. Got that.

Next, (1/6)^1 is just 1/6. And (5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4. Hmm, I need to calculate (5/6)^4. Let me compute that step by step.

First, (5/6)^2 is (25/36). Then, (25/36)^2 is (625/1296). So, (5/6)^4 is 625/1296. Let me double-check that multiplication:

5 * 5 = 25

25 * 25 = 625

6 * 6 = 36

36 * 36 = 1296

Yes, that's correct. So, (5/6)^4 is 625/1296.

Now, putting it all together:

P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296)

Hmm, let me compute that. First, multiply 5 and (1/6):

5 * (1/6) = 5/6

Then, multiply that by 625/1296:

(5/6) * (625/1296) = (5 * 625) / (6 * 1296)

Let me compute the numerator and the denominator separately.

5 * 625 = 3125

6 * 1296 = 7776

So, putting it together, that's 3125 / 7776.

Is that the probability? Let me just verify.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:

Total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice is 6^5, which is 7776. That's the denominator.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to get exactly one 6. That would be choosing which one of the five dice shows the 6, and the other four show something else.

So, the number of ways is C(5, 1) * 1 * 5^4, right? Because for the four non-6 dice, each can be 1-5, so 5 possibilities each.

Wait, let me see: C(5,1) is 5, and then 5^4 is 625. So, total favorable outcomes is 5 * 625 = 3125. So, the probability is 3125 / 7776, which matches what I got earlier.

So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the probability is 3125/777
