<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem here: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with probability involving multiple dice, it often involves combinations and the probability of independent events. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? Each outcome is equally likely, so the probability of getting any specific number, like a 6, is 1 out of 6, or 1/6. On the other hand, the probability of not getting a 6 would be 5/6 because there are five other numbers.

The problem here is asking about getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. So, out of the five dice, one should show a 6, and the other four should not show a 6. That makes me think of using combinations because the order in which the 6 appears doesn't matter – whether it's the first die, the second, etc., it's all the same in terms of probability.

Alright, so to find the probability, I think I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Let's start with the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Since each die has 6 possibilities, the total number of outcomes should be 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me compute that: 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6. That equals 7776. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 7776.

Now, how about the number of favorable outcomes? The favorable outcomes are those where exactly one die shows a 6 and the rest show numbers other than 6. To find this, I can use combinations to figure out how many ways exactly one die can be a 6 out of five dice. The number of ways to choose which one die will show the 6 is given by the combination formula "5 choose 1," which is denoted as C(5,1).

The combination formula C(n, k) is equal to n! / (k!(n - k)!), where "!" denotes factorial. So, C(5,1) is 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!). Calculating that: 5! is 120, 1! is 1, and (5-1)! is 24. So, 120 / (1×24) = 5. That means there are 5 ways to have exactly one 6 in five dice.

But wait, that's just the combinations part. For each of these combinations, the one die showing 6 has only one possible outcome (it must be a 6), and the remaining four dice must not show a 6. Each of those four dice has 5 possible outcomes (1 through 5). So, for each combination, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (for the 6) multiplied by 5^4 (for the other four dice).

Let me compute that: 5^4 is 25, so each combination results in 25 favorable outcomes. Since there are 5 such combinations, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 × 25. Let's calculate that: 5 × 25 = 125.

So, now I can put it all together. The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 125 / 7776. Hmm, let me see if that fraction can be simplified. The numerator is 125, which is 5^3, and the denominator is 7776. Let me see if they have any common factors.

7776 divided by 125: 125 goes into 7776 how many times? Well, 125 × 60 is 7500, subtracting that from 7776 gives 276. Then, 125 × 2 is 250, subtracting that leaves 26. So, no, they don't have any common factors besides 1. Therefore, the fraction 125/7776 is already in its simplest form.

To get a decimal approximation, I can divide 125 by 7776. Let me do that. Hmm, so 125 ÷ 7776. Let's see, 7776 × 0.016 is approximately 125 because 7776 × 0.01 is 77.76, and 7776 × 0.006 is approximately 46.656. Adding those together gives roughly 77.76 + 46.656 = 124.416. That's pretty close to 125. So, 0.016 approximately. Therefore, the probability is approximately 0.016, or 1.6

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it often involves combinations and the probability of independent events. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? Each number from 1 to 6 has an equal chance of appearing, which is 1/6. So, for each die, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 6 is 5/6. That seems straightforward.

Now, the problem is about rolling five dice and getting exactly one 6. So, I need to figure out how many different ways this can happen and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Let me think about the total number of possible outcomes first. Since each die has 6 sides, rolling five dice would have 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice. That seems right because each die is independent, so the total number of outcomes is 6^5.

Next, I need to find out how many of these outcomes result in exactly one 6. To do that, I should think about combinations because the order in which the 6 appears doesn't matter. It's about how many different ways exactly one die can show a 6 and the others show something else.

So, if I have five dice, the number of ways to choose exactly one die to show a 6 is given by the combination formula. The combination formula is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 5 (since there are five dice) and k is 1 (because we want exactly one 6). Let me compute that:

C(5,1) = 5!/(1!(5-1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(1*(4*3*2*1)) = 120/24 = 5.

Wait, that can't be right. Hold on, 5 choose 1 is actually 5, because there are five different dice that could be the one showing the 6. Yeah, that makes sense. So, there are five different ways to have exactly one 6 in five dice.

Now, for each of these combinations, we need to calculate the probability. Since each die is independent, the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others. So, for each combination where one die is a 6 and the others are not, the probability is (1/6) for the one die and (5/6) for each of the remaining four dice.

So, the probability for each specific combination (like the first die being a 6 and the rest not) is (1/6)*(5/6)^4. Let me compute that. First, (5/6)^4: 5^4 is 625 and 6^4 is 1296, so that's 625/1296. Then, multiplying by 1/6: (625/1296)*(1/6) = 625/7776.

But since there are five such combinations (each corresponding to one of the five dice being the 6), we need to multiply this probability by 5. So, total probability is 5*(625/7776). Let me compute that: 5*625 is 3125, so 3125/7776.

Wait, is that in simplest terms? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5*3^5. Since 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5*3^5, they don't have any common prime factors. So, 3125/7776 is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me double-check my reasoning.

Another way to think about it is: The number of favorable outcomes is 5 (choices for which die is 6) multiplied by 1 (for that die being 6) multiplied by 5^4 (for the other four dice each having
