<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability can often be found by figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, first, I should probably determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Each die has 6 sides, right? So, if I roll five dice, each die is independent of the others, and the total number of possible outcomes would be 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me check that... Yeah, for each die, there are 6 possibilities, and since there are five dice, it's 6*6*6*6*6, which is 7776. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 7776.

Now, I need the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to get exactly one 6 in those five dice. To calculate that, I think I can use combinations and then consider the specific outcomes. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here since each die is distinct but the outcome is just whether it's a 6 or not.

So, how do I calculate the number of favorable outcomes? Well, first, I need to choose which one of the five dice shows a 6. That can be done in C(5,1) ways, where C(n,k) is the combination formula. The combination formula is n! / (k!(n - k)!), so C(5,1) is 5! / (1!4!) which is 5. So, there are 5 different ways to choose which die will show the 6.

Now, for the chosen die, there's a 1/6 chance it lands on a 6, and for the other four dice, each has a 5/6 chance of not being a 6. So, since each die roll is independent, I can multiply the probabilities for each event to get the overall probability.

But wait, actually, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of favorable outcomes, since the initial method was about counting the number of favorable outcomes over total. Let's stick with that for now.

So, if one die shows a 6, the rest must show numbers from 1 to 5. Each of these non-6 numbers is considered a single outcome for each die. So, if one die is a 6, the other four dice each have 5 possible outcomes. Therefore, for each choice of die that shows the 6, there are 5^4 possible outcomes. 

Since there are 5 choices for which die shows the 6, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 multiplied by 5^4. Let me calculate that: 5 * (5^4). 5^4 is 5*5*5*5 = 625, so 5 * 625 = 3125. Therefore, there are 3125 favorable outcomes.

Putting that together with the total number of possible outcomes, the probability is 3125 / 7776. Hmm, is that the simplest form? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors.

Well, 3125 is 5^5, since 5*5=25, 25*25=625, 625*5=3125. Yeah, so it's 5^5. And 7776 divided by 6 is 1296, which is 6^4. Wait, 6^5 is 7776, right? 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. Yes, so 7776 is 6^5.

Does 3125 and 7776 have any common factors? 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5 which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. So, there's no overlap in the prime factors between 3125 and 7776, since 3125's factors are only 5s and 7776's factors are only 2s and 3s. So, that means 3125/7776 cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776. If I want to express this as a decimal, I could divide 3125 by 7776. But since the question just asks for probability, I think a fraction is acceptable here, especially since it can't be simplified further.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier: for each favorable outcome, we have one

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability problems often involve combinations and figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. 

First, let me recall that when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Each die roll is independent, meaning the result of one doesn't affect the others. So, when rolling five dice, each die has six possibilities, and the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6*6*6*6*6. That's 6^5, which is 7776. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Now, I need the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6. Hmm, so that means out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the remaining four show numbers other than 6. 

To find the number of favorable outcomes, I should use combinations. Specifically, the number of ways to choose which one of the five dice shows a 6. The number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, in this case, it's C(5,1).

Calculating that: C(5,1) = 5! / (1!(5-1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1*4*3*2*1) = 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 different ways to have exactly one 6 in the five dice.

Now, for each of these 5 ways, the one die that shows a 6 can be any one of the five dice, and the other four dice must show numbers other than 6. Since each die can show numbers 1 through 5 (excluding 6), each of the remaining four dice has 5 possible outcomes.

Therefore, for each of the 5 choices of which die shows a 6, there are 5^4 possible outcomes for the other dice. Let me calculate 5^4: 5*5*5*5 = 625. So, for each of the 5 choices, there are 625 outcomes.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625. Let me compute that: 5 * 625 = 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Earlier, I found that the total number of possible outcomes is 7776. So, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That is, 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, I wonder if this fraction can be simplified. Let me see if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 

First, let me factorize both numbers. 

3125: I know that 5^5 is 3125 because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. So, 3125 = 5^5.

7776: Let me factorize this. I know that 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5. So, 7776 = 2^5 * 3^5.

So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5. They don't have any common prime factors. Therefore, the fraction 3125/7776 is already in its simplest form.

Alternatively, I can express this as a decimal to get a sense of the probability. Let me compute 3125 divided by 7776.

3125 ÷ 7776. Let me do this division step by step.

First, 7776 goes into 31250 how many times? Let me see, 7776 * 4 is 31104. So, 4 times. 31250 - 31104 is 146. So, 4 with a remainder of 146. Now, bring down a zero: 1460.

7776 goes into 1460 zero times. So, we have 0.4 so far. Bring down another zero: 14600.

Now, 7776 goes into 14600 once, because 7776 * 1 = 7776. Subtract that from 14600:
