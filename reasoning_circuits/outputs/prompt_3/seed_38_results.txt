<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that probability questions like this often involve combinations and probabilities multiplying, so I should probably start there.

First, when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? So, each die has an equal chance of landing on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The probability of rolling any specific number is 1/6. That seems straightforward.

Now, since we have five dice, each with six possible outcomes, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling all five dice is 6^5. Let me just calculate that real quick. 6^5 is 6 multiplied by itself five times, so 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. Wait, no, hold on, 6^5 is actually 7776? That seems a bit high, but I think that's correct. Let me double-check: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. Yep, that's right. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 7776.

Okay, now, the question is asking for the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. So, I need to find out how many ways this can happen and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 7776.

To figure out the number of favorable outcomes, I think I can use combinations. Specifically, combinations without repetition because each die can only show one number. So, if I have five dice and I want exactly one of them to be a 6, I need to choose which one of the five dice will show the 6.

The number of ways to choose one die out of five is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we want to choose. In this case, n=5 and k=1, so C(5,1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1*4*3*2*1) = 5 / 1 = 5. So, there are 5 different ways to have exactly one 6 when rolling five dice.

Wait, let me think again: each die is independent, so actually, the 6 can be on any one of the five dice. So, for each die, there's a 1/6 chance of being a 6, and the other dice have to be non-6s, which is 5/6 chance each. Hmm, so does this mean that the probability is 5*(1/6)*(5/6)^4?

Let me see. So, for each die, the probability that it's the one that shows a 6 is (1/6), and the probability that the other four dice show something that's not a 6 is (5/6) for each die. Since these are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities for each die. So, the total probability should be 5*(1/6)*(5/6)^4.

Wait, but earlier I was thinking about the number of favorable outcomes, which was 5, and the total outcomes is 7776. So, the probability should also be 5 / 7776. Let me see if that's equal to 5*(1/6)*(5/6)^4. Let me calculate that.

First, (1/6) is approximately 0.166666... (5/6)^4: Let's compute that. 5/6 is approximately 0.833333... Raising that to the fourth power. 0.8333^2 is approximately 0.6944, then squared again is approximately 0.6944*0.6944. Let me calculate that. 0.6944*0.6944 is approximately 0.4823. So, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823. So, 5*(1/6)*(5/6)^4 ≈ 5 * 0.166666 * 0.4823.

Calculating 0.166666 * 0.4823 first: Let me get that precisely. 0.166666 * 0.4823. Since 0.166666 is 1/6, it's approximately 1/6 * 0.4823 ≈ 0

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability questions like this often involve combinations and maybe the binomial probability formula. Let me try to recall how that works.

First, when rolling a die, there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Each outcome is equally likely, right? So the probability of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 6 is 5/6. Since we're dealing with multiple dice, and we want exactly one 6, I think this is a binomial probability problem.

Binomial probability is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. In this case, each die roll is a trial, and getting a 6 is a success, while not getting a 6 is a failure. We have five trials (dice), and we want exactly one success (getting exactly one 6).

The formula for binomial probability is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of k successes,
- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n trials taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In this problem:
- n = 5 (since we're rolling five dice),
- k = 1 (we want exactly one 6),
- p = 1/6 (probability of rolling a 6),
- (1-p) = 5/6 (probability of not rolling a 6).

So plugging these into the formula, we get:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Now, I need to calculate each part step by step.

First, let's compute C(5, 1). The combination formula is:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

So,

C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = 5! / (1! * 4!) 

Calculating 5! (which is 5 factorial):

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

And 4! is 24, and 1! is 1.

So,

C(5, 1) = 120 / (1 * 24) = 120 / 24 = 5

Okay, so C(5, 1) is 5.

Next, (1/6)^1 is just 1/6.

Then, (5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4.

Let me calculate (5/6)^4. Hmm, 5 divided by 6 is approximately 0.8333. Raising that to the fourth power.

But maybe I should do it exactly as a fraction to keep it precise.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296

Wait, let me compute 5^4 and 6^4.

5^4 is 5*5*5*5 = 25*25 = 625.

6^4 is 6*6*6*6 = 36*36 = 1296.

So, (5/6)^4 is 625/1296.

Putting it all together:

P(1) = C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4 = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296)

Now, let's compute this.

First, multiply 5 and (1/6):

5 * (1/6) = 5/6

Then, multiply that by (625/1296):

(5/6) * (625/1296) = (5 * 625) / (6 * 1296)

Calculate numerator: 5 * 625 = 3125

Denominator: 6 * 1296 = 7776

So, P(1) = 3125 / 7776

Hmm, is this the simplest form? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors.

3125 is 5^5, because 5^5 is 3125.

7776 divided by 3125: Let's see, 3125 * 2
