<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, okay, let me think step by step. I remember that probability problems like this often involve combinations and probabilities multiplying. Let me recall how this works.

First, when rolling dice, each die has 6 sides, right? So, each roll is an independent event with 6 possible outcomes. When rolling multiple dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 raised to the number of dice. In this case, with five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is \(6^5\). Let me compute that.

\(6^5 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6\). Calculating that: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, 7776 total possible outcomes. Got that.

Now, the problem is about getting exactly one 6. So, I need to figure out how many different ways this can happen. This is where combinations come into play, I think.

We can model this as: out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the remaining four show something other than 6. So, I need to calculate the number of such favorable outcomes.

First, let's choose which one of the five dice shows the 6. The number of ways to choose one die out of five is given by the combination formula, which is "5 choose 1". The formula for combinations is \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.

So, calculating \(\binom{5}{1}\):
\(\binom{5}{1} = \frac{5!}{1!(5 - 1)!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{1 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{120}{24} = 5\). So, there are 5 ways to choose which die shows the 6.

Now, for the die that shows 6, it has only one outcome: 6. But for the remaining four dice, each must show something other than 6. Since a die has six faces, the number of outcomes that are not 6 is 5 (they can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).

Therefore, for each of the four remaining dice, there are 5 possible outcomes. Since the dice are independent, the total number of outcomes for these four dice is \(5^4\). Let me compute that.

\(5^4 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5\). Calculating step by step: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, 625 possible outcomes for the four non-6 dice.

Putting this all together, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose the die showing 6 multiplied by the number of outcomes for the other dice. So that's \(5 \times 625 = 3125\).

Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check. Choosing one die out of five: 5 ways. Each of the other four dice has 5 possibilities: 5^4=625. So, 5 * 625 = 3125. Yes, that seems correct.

So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's \( \frac{3125}{7776} \).

Hmm, let me compute that fraction to see what it is approximately. But maybe the question just wants the fractional form. Since 3125 and 7776, do they share any common factors?

Well, 3125 is 5^5, because 5^5=3125. And 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 *3^5.

So, the numerator is 5^5 and the denominator is (2*3)^5. So, they don't share any common factors besides 1. Therefore, the fraction can't be simplified further.

But wait, just to make sure, 3125 is 5^5, which is 3125. 7776 divided by 5 is 1555.2, so it's not a multiple of 5. So, 312

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it's often useful to use combinations and the concept of independent events. Let me break this down step by step.

First, when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? So, each die has an equal chance of landing on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Now, since we're dealing with five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 raised to the power of 5. Let me calculate that real quick: 6^5. 6*6 is 36, 36*6 is 216, 216*6 is 1296, and 1296*6 is 7776. So, there are 7,776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice. That's our denominator for the probability.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out the numerator, which is the number of favorable outcomes—i.e., the number of ways to get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, how do I calculate that?

I think this is where combinations come into play. Because we want exactly one 6, we need to choose which one of the five dice shows a 6. The number of ways to choose one die out of five is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.

So, plugging in the numbers, we have C(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1*4*3*2*1) = 5 / 1 = 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which die will show the 6.

But wait, that's not all. Once we've decided which die shows the 6, the other four dice must show something other than a 6. Since each die has 5 possible outcomes (1-5), the number of ways the other four dice can show non-6 numbers is 5^4.

Let me calculate that: 5*5*5*5 = 625. So, for each of the 5 choices of the die showing 6, there are 625 ways the other dice can show non-6 numbers.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625. Let me do that multiplication: 5 * 625. Well, 625 * 5 is 3,125. So, 3,125 favorable outcomes.

Putting it all together, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 3,125 / 7,776.

Hmm, can this fraction be simplified? Let me see. Both numbers are divisible by 25? Let's check: 3,125 ÷ 25 is 125, and 7,776 ÷ 25 is 310.04. Hmm, that's not a whole number, so 25 isn't a common divisor. How about 5? 3,125 ÷ 5 is 625, and 7,776 ÷ 5 is 1,555.2. Not a whole number either. Maybe 3? 3,125 ÷ 3 is approximately 1,041.666, which isn't a whole number. 7,776 ÷ 3 is 2,592. So, 3 is a common divisor. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 3.

3,125 ÷ 3 is about 1,041.666, which is not a whole number. So, 3 isn't a common divisor of both. Maybe 1? Well, 1 is trivial, so that doesn't help. Hmm, maybe the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Alternatively, I can convert this fraction to a decimal to make it more understandable. Let me do that. So, 3,125 divided by 7,776. Let me set that up.

First, 7,776 goes into 3,125 zero times. So, we write it as 0. and then continue the division. Let me see, 7,776 goes into 31,250 how many times? Let's see, 7,776 * 4 is 31,104. Subtract that from 31,250: 31,250 - 31,104 is 146. Bring down the next 0: 1,460.

7,776 goes into 1,460
