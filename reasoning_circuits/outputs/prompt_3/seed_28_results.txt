<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let's see. Probability problems can be tricky, but I remember something about combinatorics. Maybe I should break it down step by step.

First, when rolling dice, each die has six possible outcomes, right? So, for five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me calculate that. 6 times 6 is 36, times 6 is 216, times 6 is 1296, times 6 is 7776. So, there are 7776 total possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Okay, that's my denominator for the probability.

Now, the numerator should be the number of favorable outcomes, which are the ones where exactly one die shows a 6. So, I need to figure out how many ways this can happen. Hmm, this seems like a combination problem. I think I need to choose which one of the five dice shows the 6, and then the other four dice should show something that's not a 6. 

Wait, is that right? Yeah, exactly. So, if I fix which die is the 6, the others have to be non-6. Each die has 5 other numbers (1-5), so for the other four dice, each has 5 possible outcomes. So, the number of favorable outcomes would be the number of ways to choose the one die that's a 6 times the number of outcomes for the remaining four dice.

Mathematically, that's the combination formula. The number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 is "5 choose 1", which is denoted as C(5,1) or sometimes as 5C1. And that's equal to 5. Then, for the other four dice, each has 5 possible outcomes, so 5^4.

Let me compute that. 5^4 is 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 5*625. Let's calculate that: 5*600=3000 and 5*25=125, so together 3125. So, 3125 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable divided by total outcomes, which is 3125 / 7776. I should simplify this fraction if possible. Let's see if 3125 and 7776 have a common divisor.

Hmm, 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5. So, 3125 factors are all 5s, and 7776 factors are 2s and 3s, so they don't have any common factors other than 1. So, that fraction is already in its simplest form.

Alternatively, to get a decimal or percentage, I can divide 3125 by 7776. Let me do that division. 3125 ÷ 7776. Hmm, 7776 goes into 3125 zero times. Let me write it as 3125.0000...

Well, 7776 goes into 31250 about four times (4*7776=31104). Subtracting, 31250 - 31104 = 146. Bring down a zero: 1460. 7776 goes into 1460 zero times. Bring down another zero: 14600. 7776 goes into 14600 once (7776*1=7776). Subtract: 14600 - 7776=6824. Bring down a zero: 68240. 7776 goes into 68240 about eight times (7776*8=62208). Subtract: 68240 - 62208=6032. Bring down a zero: 60320. 7776 goes into 60320 seven times (7776*7=54432). Subtract: 60320 - 54432=5888. Bring down a zero: 58880. 7776 goes into 58880 seven times (7776*7=54432). Subtract: 58880 - 54432=4448. Bring down a zero: 44480. 7776 goes into 44480 five times (7776*5=38880). Subtract: 44480 - 38880=5600. Bring down a zero: 56000. 7776 goes into 56000 seven times (7776*7=54432). Subtract: 56000 - 54432=1568. Bring down a zero: 15680. 7776 goes into 15680 two times (7776*2=15552). Subtract: 15680 -

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving dice, it often involves combinations and maybe the binomial probability formula. Let me think through this step by step.

First, when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? So for each die, the probability of getting a 6 is 1/6, and the probability of not getting a 6 is 5/6. Since we're rolling five dice, each die is independent of the others, so the outcome of one doesn't affect the others.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability of getting exactly one 6. That means out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the other four show something else, not 6. So I need to calculate how many ways this can happen and then multiply that by the probability of each such outcome.

Let me break it down. How many ways can exactly one die show a 6? That should be the number of ways to choose which one die out of the five is the 6. I think this is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 is given by the combination formula, which is:

\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
\]

So here, n is 5 and k is 1. Plugging that in:

\[
C(5, 1) = \frac{5!}{1!(5 - 1)!} = \frac{5!}{1!4!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{1 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{120}{24} = 5
\]

So there are 5 different ways to get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice.

Now, for each of these ways, the probability of getting exactly one 6 is calculated by multiplying the probability of getting a 6 on one die and the probability of not getting a 6 on the other four dice. Since each die is independent, we can multiply the probabilities.

So, the probability for one specific arrangement where die 1 is 6 and dice 2-5 are not 6 is:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \times \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4
\]

But since there are 5 such arrangements, we need to multiply this probability by 5. So the total probability is:

\[
5 \times \left( \frac{1}{6} \times \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \right)
\]

Let me compute that. First, let's calculate \(\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4\):

\[
\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{5^4}{6^4} = \frac{625}{1296}
\]

Then multiply by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{625}{1296} = \frac{625}{7776}
\]

Now, multiply by 5:

\[
5 \times \frac{625}{7776} = \frac{3125}{7776}
\]

So, the probability is \(\frac{3125}{7776}\). Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let me verify the exponent. When I calculated \(\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4\), that's because there are four dice that are not 6, each with probability \(\frac{5}{6}\). So that part seems right. Then, multiplying by \(\frac{1}{6}\) for the one die that is a 6, and then by 5 for the number of ways. So 5 times 625 over 7776. 5 times 625 is 3125, yes. And 6 to the 5th power is 7776 because 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think about the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Each die has 6 possibilities, so the total number of outcomes is \(6^5 = 7776\). That's the denominator.

The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to get exactly one 6. As we calculated,
