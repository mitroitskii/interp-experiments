<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability question here: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with probability involving multiple dice, it's often a good idea to think in terms of combinatorics. Each die roll is an independent event, so the probability of each roll is independent of the others. Since I'm rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is \(6^5\), right? Let me verify that: each die has 6 possible outcomes, so for five dice, it would be \(6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 6^5\). Let me compute that: 6*6 is 36, 36*6 is 216, 216*6 is 1296, and 1296*6 is 7776. So the total number of possible outcomes is 7776.

Now, the question asks for the probability of getting exactly one 6. So I need to find the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one of the five dice shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6.

To compute this, I can use combinations. Specifically, I need to choose which one of the five dice will show a 6. The number of ways to choose this is given by the combination formula \(C(n, k)\), which is \( \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \). In this case, n is 5 (since there are five dice) and k is 1 (since we want exactly one 6). So that would be \(C(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1) / (1 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1) = 5 / 1 = 5\). So there are 5 ways to choose which die will show a 6.

Now, for the other four dice, none of them should show a 6. So each of these four dice can only show numbers from 1 to 5. That means each of these four dice has 5 possible outcomes instead of 6. So the number of outcomes for these four dice is \(5^4\). Let me calculate that: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, 625 possible outcomes for the other four dice.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose which die is 6 multiplied by the number of ways the other dice can be non-6. That would be \(5 \times 625 = 3125\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So 5 choices for which die is 6, and each of the other four dice has 5 choices (1-5). So 5^4 is 625 for the non-6 outcomes, and 5 multiplied by 625 gives 3125 total favorable outcomes.

Okay, so the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So that's \(3125 / 7776\).

Hmm, can I simplify this fraction? Let's see if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 3125 is 5^5 because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5, so 2^5 * 3^5. Since 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5, they don't share any common prime factors. So the fraction can't be simplified further.

Therefore, the probability is \(3125 / 7776\). Let me write that as a decimal to understand it better. So, 3125 ÷ 7776. Let me do that division: 3125 ÷ 7776.

First, 7776 goes into 31250 about 4 times, since 7776*4=31104. Subtract that from 31250, we get 31250 - 31104 = 146. Then bring down a zero: 1460.

7776 goes into 1460 zero times, so next decimal place is 0. Then we have 14600. How many times does 7776 go into 14600? Let me compute 7776*1=7776. 14600-7776=6824. Bring down a zero

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to probability, but I'll do my best.

First, I know that when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? Each number from 1 to 6 has an equal chance of landing face up. So, if I roll five dice, each die is independent of the others, meaning the outcome of one doesn't affect the others. 

The question is asking for the probability of getting exactly one 6 in those five rolls. So, I need to calculate how likely it is that among the five dice, one shows a 6 and the other four show numbers other than 6. Hmm, okay.

I remember something about combinations being used in probability when the order doesn't matter. Since each die is separate, the order in which the 6s appear doesn't matter here. So, maybe I can use combinations to figure out how many ways this can happen.

Let me break it down. There are five dice, and I want exactly one of them to show a 6. So, first, I should figure out how many ways this can happen. That would be the number of ways to choose which one die out of the five shows a 6. That sounds like a combination problem where I choose 1 die out of 5, which is denoted as C(5,1).

Calculating C(5,1), that's 5! / (1! * (5-1)!) = 5 / (1 * 4) = 5. So, there are 5 different ways to get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. 

But wait, that's just the number of favorable outcomes. I also need to consider the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Since each die has 6 possible outcomes, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6*6*6*6*6. Hmm, 6^5 is 7776. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes in total.

Now, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, that would be 5 divided by 7776. Let me write that down: 5/7776. 

But maybe I can simplify that fraction? Let me see if 5 and 7776 have any common divisors. 5 is a prime number, so I just need to check if 5 divides into 7776. 7776 divided by 5 is 1555.2, which isn't an integer, so 5 is not a factor of 7776. Therefore, the fraction 5/7776 is already in its simplest form.

Alternatively, I can express this probability as a decimal to make it more understandable. Let me do that. So, 5 divided by 7776. Let me compute that. 

First, 7776 divided by 5 is 1555.2, so 5 divided by 7776 is approximately 0.000645161. Rounding that to, say, five decimal places, it's about 0.00064. So, the probability is roughly 0.064%.

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, 5 out of 7776. Hmm, 7776 is a big number, so 5 is indeed a small fraction of that. So, 0.064% seems low, but considering that getting exactly one 6 is a specific outcome, it makes sense.

Let me just cross-verify my approach. Another way to think about this is using probability rules. The probability of getting exactly one 6 is equal to the number of ways to get one 6 and four non-6s multiplied by the probability of each such outcome.

So, the number of ways is C(5,1) as before, which is 5. The probability of getting a 6 on one die is 1/6, and the probability of not getting a 6 on the other four dice is (5/6)^4, since each die has a 5/6 chance of not showing a 6.

So, putting that together, the probability is C(5,1) * (1/6) * (5/6)^4. Let me calculate that.

First, (5/6)^4 is (625/1296). Then, multiplying by (1/6), that gives 625/7776. Then, multiplying by 5, which is the number of combinations, gives 3125/7776.

Wait a second, hold on. Earlier, I
