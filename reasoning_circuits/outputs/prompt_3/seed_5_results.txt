Okay, so I have this probability problem: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that probability problems often involve combinations and figuring out the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. But I need to be careful here, so let me not rush.

First, when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? Numbers 1 through 6, each with equal probability. So, when rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes should be 6 multiplied by itself five times. That is, 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. Wait, hold on, 6^5 is 7776. Hmm, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, let me recalculate:

6*6=36,

36*6=216,

216*6=1296,

1296*6=7776. Yeah, that seems correct. So, 6^5 is indeed 7776. So, that's our total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Now, the problem is about getting exactly one 6. So, how do we count the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6.

Hmm, I think this is a combinatorial problem. Specifically, I need to compute the number of ways exactly one die can be a 6, and the rest can be any number except 6. So, perhaps I should use the concept of combinations here.

The number of ways to choose which one die shows the 6 is the combination of 5 dice taken 1 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!). So, in this case, n=5 and k=1. Let me calculate that:

C(5,1) = 5! / (1! * (5-1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1 * 4*3*2*1) = 120 / 24 = 5.

So, there are 5 ways to choose which one die shows the 6.

Now, for the remaining four dice, they must show numbers other than 6. Since a die has numbers 1 through 6, if we exclude 6, then each of the remaining four dice can show 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. That is, 5 possible outcomes for each die.

Since each die is independent, the number of outcomes for the remaining four dice is 5 multiplied by itself four times, which is 5^4. Let me compute that: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, 625 possible outcomes for the non-6 dice.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose the die that shows 6 multiplied by the number of outcomes for the other dice. That is, 5 * 625.

Calculating that: 5*625. Let me think: 625 * 5 is 3125. So, 3125 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 3125 / 7776.

Wait, is that the simplest form? Let me see if I can reduce that fraction. Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3125 and 7776.

First, factorize 3125: 3125 is 5^5, since 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125.

Now, factorize 7776: Let me divide by 6, 7776 / 6 = 1296. 1296 / 6 = 216. 216 /6=36. 36/6=6. 6/6=1. So, 7776=6^5. But 6 is 2*3, so 7776= (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5.

So, 7776=2^5 * 3^5.

3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5.

So, there are no common prime factors between 3125 and 7776. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form. So, the probability is 3125/

Okay, so I have this probability problem: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that probability problems often involve combinations and figuring out the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. Let me recall, when rolling dice, each die has 6 faces, so rolling five dice would have 6^5 total possible outcomes, right? That would be 7776. Hmm, that seems a lot, but okay.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. So, out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. I think I need to use combinations here because the order in which the 6 appears doesn't matter. So, how many ways can one 6 appear among five dice? That should be the combination of 5 dice taken 1 at a time, which is denoted as C(5,1). Let me calculate that: 5 choose 1 is 5. So, there are 5 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

But wait, each die that isn't a 6 can show any number from 1 to 5, right? Because if it's not a 6, it can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, for each of the remaining four dice, there are 5 possible outcomes. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 (for the position of the 6) multiplied by 5^4 (for the other four dice). Let me compute that: 5^4 is 625, and 5 times 625 is 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes.

Now, to find the probability, I divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice is 6^5, which is 7776. So, the probability is 3125 divided by 7776. Let me write that as a fraction: 3125/7776.

Hmm, is this fraction reducible? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 3125 is 5^5, right? Because 5^5 is 3125. And 7776 is 6^5, which is (2×3)^5, so that's 2^5×3^5. Since 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5×3^5, they don't share any common prime factors. So, the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776. Let me just double-check my reasoning. So, I considered the number of ways to have exactly one 6, which is 5 choose 1, and for each of the remaining four dice, they can be 1-5, so 5 options each. So, 5×5^4 = 5^5 = 3125. The total outcomes are 6^5 = 7776. So, yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the probability of getting one 6 and four non-6s. The probability of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1/6, and the probability of rolling a non-6 is 5/6. So, the probability for one specific die being 6 and the others being non-6 is (1/6)×(5/6)^4. Since there are five dice, I need to multiply this by 5, right? So, that would be 5×(1/6)×(5/6)^4.

Let me calculate that: first, (5/6)^4. 5/6 to the power of 4 is (625/1296). Then, 5×(1/6)×(625/1296). Let me compute 5×(1/6) first, which is 5/6. Then, 5/6 multiplied by 625/1296. Let's see, 5×625 is 3125, and 6×1296 is 7776. So, that gives 3125/7776, which is the same as before. So, this method also gives the same result. That makes me more confident that the answer is correct.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second method. So, the probability is 5×(1/6)×(5/6)^4. Let me compute (5/6)^4 first. 5/6 is approximately 0.
