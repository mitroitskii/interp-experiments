Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let's think about it step by step. 

First off, when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Each of these outcomes is equally likely, right? So the probability of getting a specific number, like a 6, on a single roll is 1 out of 6, or 1/6. Conversely, the probability of not getting a 6 on a single roll would be 5/6 because there are five other numbers.

Now, the question is about rolling five dice and getting exactly one 6. Hmm, so I need to calculate the probability of this specific event happening. 

Let me recall, when dealing with probabilities involving multiple independent events (like rolling dice), I can use combinations and the multiplication rule for independent probabilities. Since each die roll is independent, the outcome of one doesn't affect the others. So that should help.

Okay, so we want exactly one 6 out of five dice. That means out of the five dice rolled, one die shows a 6, and the remaining four show numbers other than 6. Hmm, so we're looking for the probability of exactly one success (getting a 6) in five trials (dice rolls), where each trial has a success probability of 1/6.

Wait a second, is this a binomial probability problem? Because each die is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: success (rolling a 6) or failure (rolling anything else). So, yes, binomial distribution seems to fit here.

The binomial probability formula is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- (1-p) is the probability of failure on a single trial,
- n is the number of trials.

In our case:
- n = 5 (since we're rolling five dice),
- k = 1 (we want exactly one 6),
- p = 1/6,
- 1 - p = 5/6.

So plugging these into the formula, we get:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Now, I need to compute each part of this. 

First, C(5, 1) is the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 to be the 6. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where "!" denotes factorial.

So, C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)) = 5 / 1 = 5.

Okay, so C(5, 1) is 5.

Next, (1/6)^1 is just 1/6.

Then, (5/6)^(5 - 1) is (5/6)^4. Let me compute that.

(5/6)^4 = (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6). Calculating that step by step:

First, (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.

Then, 25/36 * (5/6) = 125/216.

Then, 125/216 * (5/6) = 625/1296.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Wait, (5/6)^4 is (5^4)/(6^4) which is 625/1296. Yeah, that's correct.

So putting it all together, P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296).

Hmm, let me compute that. First, multiply 5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

Then, 5/6 * 625/1296.

Multiply the numerators: 5 * 625 = 3125.

Multiply the denominators: 6 * 1296. Let's compute that.

6 * 1296: 1296 * 6. 1000*6=6000, 200*6=1200, 90*6=540,

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it often involves combinations and some understanding of how each die behaves independently. 

First, let me recall the basics. Each die has six sides, numbered 1 through 6, and when you roll it, each number has an equal chance of landing face up, which is 1/6. Now, when we roll multiple dice, the outcomes are independent, meaning the result of one die doesn't affect the others. 

The problem is asking for the probability of getting exactly one 6 out of five dice. That means out of the five dice rolled, one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. 

I think this is a case where I can use the binomial probability formula. Let me remember what that is. The binomial probability formula gives the probability of having exactly k successes in n independent trials, where each trial has a success probability of p. The formula is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. So in this case, each die can be considered a trial, getting a 6 is a success, and not getting a 6 is a failure. 

Let me identify the values here. n is 5 because we're rolling five dice. k is 1 because we want exactly one 6. p is the probability of getting a 6 on a single die, which is 1/6. Then, (1-p) is the probability of not getting a 6, which is 5/6.

So plugging these into the formula, we get:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Let me compute each part step by step. First, C(5, 1). I think that's the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 to be the one that shows a 6. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where "!" denotes factorial.

So, C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = 5! / (1! * 4!) 

Calculating that, 5! is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120. 4! is 24, and 1! is 1. So 120 / (1 * 24) = 5. So, C(5, 1) is 5.

Next, (1/6)^1 is just 1/6. Then, (5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4. Let me compute that. 

(5/6)^4 is equal to (5^4)/(6^4). Calculating numerator: 5^4 is 625. Denominator: 6^4 is 1296. So, 625/1296.

Now, putting it all together:

P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296)

Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 5 and (1/6):

5 * (1/6) = 5/6

Then, multiply that result by (625/1296):

(5/6) * (625/1296)

Multiplying the numerators: 5 * 625 = 3125

Multiplying the denominators: 6 * 1296 = 7776

So, P(1) = 3125 / 7776

Hmm, can this fraction be simplified? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 

3125 is 5^5, because 5*5*5*5*5 = 3125. 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. Since 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5, they don't share any common prime factors. So the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776. If I wanted to express this as a decimal, I could divide 3125 by 7776. Let me approximate that. 

3125 ÷ 7776 ≈ 0.4019, so approximately 40.19%.
