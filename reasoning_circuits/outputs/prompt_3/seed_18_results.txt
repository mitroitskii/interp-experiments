<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Since each die has six possible outcomes, the total number of outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5.

Next, I should find the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one of the five dice shows a 6. There are five different positions where the 6 could appear. For each of these positions, the other four dice must show numbers other than 6. Each of these four dice has five possible outcomes (1 through 5).

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is calculated as 5 multiplied by (5^4).

Finally, to find the probability, I divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. This gives me the probability of rolling exactly one 6 when rolling five dice.

To determine the probability of rolling exactly one **6** when rolling five dice, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Possible Outcomes:**

   Each die has 6 possible outcomes. When rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:
   
   \[
   6^5 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 7776
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the Number of Favorable Outcomes:**

   We want exactly one **6** and the other four dice to show numbers other than **6**. 

   - **Choose the Position for the 6:** There are **5** possible positions for the single **6**.
   
   - **Determine Outcomes for the Remaining Dice:** Each of the remaining **4** dice can show a number from **1** to **5**, giving **5** possibilities per die. Therefore, the number of outcomes for these **4** dice is:
     
     \[
     5^4 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 625
     \]
   
   - **Total Favorable Outcomes:** Multiply the number of positions by the outcomes of the remaining dice:
     
     \[
     5 \times 625 = 3125
     \]

3. **Calculate the Probability:**

   The probability \( P \) of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:
   
   \[
   P = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Outcomes}} = \frac{3125}{7776}
   \]
   
4. **Simplify the Fraction:**

   The fraction \(\frac{3125}{7776}\) is already in its simplest form.

5. **Final Answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{\dfrac{3125}{7776}}
   \]

Alright, so I have this probability problem here: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that when dealing with probability, especially with multiple dice, it often involves combinations and understanding the different outcomes. So, rolling five dice, each die has six faces, numbers 1 through 6. I need exactly one of them to show a 6 and the rest should show something else, not 6.

Let me break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of possible outcomes**: Since each die has 6 sides and we're rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me compute that. 6^5 is 6*6*6*6*6. Calculating that: 6*6 is 36, 36*6 is 216, 216*6 is 1296, and 1296*6 is 7776. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Got that.

2. **Number of favorable outcomes**: This is the number of ways to get exactly one 6 and four non-6 numbers. Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out how many different ways this can happen.

   - First, choose which one of the five dice shows the 6. Since there are five dice, the number of ways to choose which die is C(5,1), which is 5. I remember that C(n,k) is calculated as n!/(k!(n-k)!), so C(5,1) is 5!/(1!4!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(1*4*3*2*1) = 5/1 = 5. That makes sense.

   - Now, for the die that shows 6, it's fixed. But for the other four dice, each of them can show any number except 6. Each die has 5 possible outcomes (1,2,3,4,5). So, for each of these four dice, there are 5 choices.

   - Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose the die that shows 6 multiplied by the number of ways the other dice can show non-6 numbers. That would be C(5,1) * 5^4.

   - Let me compute that. 5^4 is 5*5*5*5. 5*5 is 25, 25*5 is 125, 125*5 is 625. So, 5^4 is 625. Then, multiplying that by C(5,1) which is 5, we get 5*625 = 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes.

3. **Calculating the probability**: Probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that would be 3125 divided by 7776.

   Let me see if I can simplify that fraction. 3125 and 7776. Hmm, 3125 is 5^5, because 5*5*5*5*5 is 3125. 7776 is 6^5, as I calculated earlier. So, the fraction is 5^5 / 6^5.

   That can be written as (5/6)^5. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

   (5/6)^5 is 5^5 / 6^5, which is 3125 / 7776. Yes, that's correct. So, the probability is (5/6)^5.

   Alternatively, if I want to present it as a fraction, it's 3125/7776. I can check if this reduces, but since 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 6^5, and 5 and 6 are coprime, there are no common factors, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

4. **Double-checking the logic**: Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, total outcomes are 6^5, which is correct. The favorable outcomes are choosing one die to be 6 and the rest non-6. That seems right.

   The number of ways to choose the die is 5, that's correct. Each non-6 die has 5 options, so 5^4 is 625, multiplied by 5 is 3125. So, 3125/7776. That seems consistent.

   Alternatively, I can think of it as the probability of getting exactly one success in five trials, where the success probability is 1/6
