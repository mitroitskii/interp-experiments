Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that probability problems often involve combinations and the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. 

First, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Each die has 6 faces, so for five dice, the total number should be 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that. 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, total possible outcomes are 7776. Got that down.

Next, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to get exactly one 6 and four non-6 numbers. Since we're dealing with dice, the numbers on each die can be 1 through 5 or 6. So, the numbers that are not 6 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That means there are 5 possible numbers that are not 6.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes would be equal to the number of ways we can choose which one die shows a 6 and which four show non-6 numbers. This sounds like a combinatorics problem where I have to use combinations. Specifically, I think it's a combination with repetition, but actually, since each die is distinct (they're separate), it should be a combination without repetition.

Wait, no, actually, it's about selecting positions. So, there are five dice, and I need to choose one die to show a 6. The number of ways to choose which die shows the 6 is "5 choose 1", which is 5. Then, for each of the remaining four dice, each must show a number that's not 6, i.e., one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, for each of the remaining four dice, there are 5 possible numbers. 

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes should be 5 (choices for which die is 6) multiplied by 5^4 (each of the other dice has 5 choices). Let me compute that. 5^4 is 625, so 5*625=3125. So, 3125 favorable outcomes.

Wait, let me double-check that reasoning. So, choosing which die is 6: 5 choices. Then, for the other four dice, each has 5 options. So yes, 5*5^4=5^5=3125. Got it.

Alternatively, I can think of it as multinomial coefficients. The probability of getting exactly one 6 is the same as the number of ways multiplied by the probability of each such outcome. The probability of getting a 6 on one die is 1/6, and the probability of getting non-6 on the others is 5/6 each. So, the probability should be C(5,1)*(1/6)*(5/6)^4.

Which is the same as 5*(1/6)*(625/1296). Let's compute this.

First, 5*(1/6) is 5/6. Then, 5/6 multiplied by 625/1296. Wait, actually, no. It should be 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4.

Wait, maybe let me compute step by step:

5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

(5/6)^4 is (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296.

So, then 5/6 * 625/1296. Wait, no, that's not quite right. It should be 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4.

Which is 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296).

Compute that: 5*625=3125.

So, 3125*(1/6)*(1/1296). Wait, no, 3125*(1/6)*(625/1296)? No, hold on.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. 

The probability is: number of ways * probability of each way.

Number of ways is 5*(5^4), which is 5*625=3125.

Each outcome has a probability of (1/6)*(5/6)^4.

Therefore, total probability is 3125*(1/6)*(5/6)^4.

Compute this step by step:

First, compute (5/6)^4.

5^4 is

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that probability problems often involve combinations and maybe something called binomial probability. Let me recall what I know.

First, when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? Each face has an equal chance of landing face up. So, the probability of getting a 6 on a single die roll is 1/6, and the probability of not getting a 6 is 5/6. That makes sense.

Now, the problem is about rolling five dice and getting exactly one 6. Hmm, so I need to consider all the possible ways this can happen. I think this is a case where I can use combinations because the order in which the dice show up doesn't matter—whether I get a 6 on the first die or the fifth, it's still just one 6.

Let me break it down. I need exactly one 6 and the rest of the dice showing something other than 6. So, for one die to show a 6, I have 5 choices (since there are five dice). Then, for the remaining four dice, each of them must show something that's not a 6. Since each die has five non-6 sides, each of these four dice has five possible outcomes.

So, the number of successful outcomes would be the number of ways to choose which one die shows a 6, multiplied by the number of outcomes for that die, and then multiplied by the number of outcomes for the remaining dice. That sounds a bit complicated, but let me write it down.

First, the number of ways to choose which one die shows a 6. That should be the combination of 5 dice taken 1 at a time, which is denoted as C(5,1). I think the formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where "!" denotes factorial. So, C(5,1) would be 5! / (1! * (5-1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1 * 4*3*2*1) = 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which die shows the 6.

Next, for that chosen die, there's only one outcome where it shows a 6. So, that's straightforward—1 way.

Then, for each of the remaining four dice, they can show any number except 6. Since a die has 6 sides, and one is 6, there are 5 non-6 sides. So, each of these four dice has 5 possible outcomes. Therefore, the number of outcomes for the remaining four dice is 5^4.

Calculating 5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, 5^4 is 625.

Therefore, the total number of successful outcomes is C(5,1) * 1 * 5^4 = 5 * 1 * 625 = 3125.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mess that up. So, choosing which die is 5 choices, each of those has 1 way to be a 6, and then the rest have 5 choices each. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice is 6^5, since each die has 6 possibilities and they're independent. Let me calculate that. 6^5: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, 6^5 is 7776.

Therefore, the probability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, can this fraction be simplified? Let's see. Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 3125 is 5^5, because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. And 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5. They don't have any common prime factors, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

So, the probability is 3125/7776. If I want to write this as a decimal, I can divide 3125 by
