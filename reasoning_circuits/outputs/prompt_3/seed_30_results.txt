<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember this has something to do with combinations and probability. But I need to make sure I get all the details right.

First, let me recall that when we roll a die, there are 6 possible outcomes, right? Each die is independent, so when you roll five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me calculate that. 6*6*6*6*6 is... 6*6 is 36, times 6 is 216, times 6 is 1296, times 6 is 7776. So there are 7776 total possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Now, the question is asking for the probability of getting exactly one 6. So, I need to figure out how many different ways this can happen. That's where combinations come in, I think. Because the order in which the 6s appear doesn't matter—so it's about combinations, not permutations.

Right, so we need to choose 1 die out of 5 to show a 6. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number, which is 5, and k is the number we want to choose, which is 1.

So, calculating that, 5! is 120, and 1! is 1, and (5 - 1)! is 24, so 120 / (1 * 24) is 5. So there are 5 different ways to get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice.

But wait, it's not just about choosing the die that shows a 6. Each die that is a 6 has a probability of 1/6, and the other dice that are not 6 have a probability of 5/6 each. Since the dice are independent, I think I need to multiply the probabilities for each case.

Let me think. For each specific die that shows a 6, the probability is (1/6) for that die, and (5/6) for each of the other four dice. Since these are independent, I can multiply them together. So the probability for each specific case is (1/6) * (5/6)^4.

But wait, there are 5 such specific cases because any one of the five dice could be the one showing 6. So to get the total probability, I need to multiply the probability of each specific case by 5. So that would be 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4.

Let me calculate that. First, compute (5/6)^4. 5^4 is 625 and 6^4 is 1296. So (5/6)^4 is 625/1296. Then, multiplying by 1/6, we get (625/1296) * (1/6) = 625/7776. Then, multiplying by 5, we get 3125/7776.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 choose 1, which is 5. Each favorable outcome has a probability of (1/6) for the selected die and (5/6) for the others. So yes, each outcome has a probability of (1/6)*(5/6)^4, and there are 5 such outcomes, so 5*(1/6)*(5/6)^4.

Computing 5*(1/6)*(625/1296). Wait, 5*(1/6) is 5/6, so 5/6 * 625/1296 is (5*625)/(6*1296). 5*625 is 3125 and 6*1296 is 7776, so 3125/7776.

So, is 3125/7776 the probability? Let me see if that reduces or if I did something wrong.

Well, 3125 is 5^5, right? 5*5*5*5*5 is 3125. And 7776 is 6^5, as I computed earlier. So 7776 is 6*6*6*6*6. So the fraction 3125/7776 can't be simplified because 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 6^5, and 5 and 6 are coprime. So that's the reduced form.

Alternatively, is there another way to think about this? Let's

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it's often helpful to use combinatorics. Specifically, the binomial probability formula might be useful here. Let me recall the formula. The probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, p is the probability of success on a single trial, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In this case, rolling a die can be considered a trial. Getting a 6 is a success, and not getting a 6 is a failure. So, n is 5 because we're rolling five dice. k is 1 because we want exactly one 6. The probability of success on a single trial, p, is 1/6, since there are six possible outcomes on a die and only one is a 6. The probability of failure, (1-p), is 5/6.

So, plugging these into the formula, we get:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, C(5, 1). I know that combinations are calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, plugging in n=5 and k=1:

C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1 * 4*3*2*1) = 120 / 24 = 5.

Okay, so C(5,1) is 5. That makes sense because there are 5 different dice, and any one of them could be the one showing a 6.

Next, (1/6)^1 is just 1/6.

Then, (5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4. Let me calculate that. (5/6)^4 is the same as (5^4)/(6^4). 5^4 is 625 and 6^4 is 1296. So, 625/1296.

Now, putting it all together:

P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, multiply 5 and 1/6: 5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

Then, multiply that result by 625/1296: (5/6) * (625/1296).

Multiplying the numerators: 5 * 625 = 3125.

Multiplying the denominators: 6 * 1296. Hmm, 6 * 1296. Let me compute that. 1296 * 6: 1296 * 5 is 6480, plus 1296 is 7776.

So, that gives us 3125/7776.

Wait, let me confirm that. 5 * 625 is indeed 3125. And 6 * 1296 is 7776. So, yes, 3125/7776.

Is that the final answer? Let me double-check my steps.

1. Calculated the combination C(5,1) correctly as 5.
2. Calculated (1/6)^1 as 1/6.
3. Calculated (5/6)^4 as 625/1296.
4. Multiplied all together: 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296) = 3125/7776.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

The total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice is 6^5, which is 7776. That's because each die has 6 outcomes and there are five dice, so 6*6*6*6*6 = 6^5 = 7776.

The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to get exactly one 6. That means we need to choose which one of the five dice shows the 6, and the other four dice must show something other than 6. For each of the other four dice, there are 5 possible outcomes (1,2,3,4,5).

So, the number of favorable
