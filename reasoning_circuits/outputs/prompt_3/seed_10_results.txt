<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I've got this probability question: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. I think I need to use some combinatorics here, right?

First off, when we talk about probability, especially with multiple dice, it's often about figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice should be 6^5 because each die has 6 possible outcomes and we're rolling five. Let me calculate that real quick: 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6. That's 7776. Okay, so the denominator in my probability will be 7776.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out how many favorable outcomes there are. A favorable outcome in this case is getting exactly one 6 and the other four dice showing numbers other than 6. So, I need to count how many different ways this can happen.

I recall that this is a combinations problem because the order in which the dice show a 6 or not doesn't matter. It's about selecting which dice show a 6 and which ones don't. Since I want exactly one 6, I need to choose one die out of the five to show a 6. The number of ways to choose one die from five is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we want to choose.

So, in this case, n is 5, and k is 1. Plugging that into the formula: C(5,1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)! ) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 24) ) = 120 / 24 = 5. Okay, so there are 5 ways to choose which one die shows a 6.

But wait, that's just selecting the die; we also have to consider what the other dice show. The other four dice must show numbers other than 6. Each of these four dice has 5 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, for each of the other four dice, there are 5 choices.

Therefore, for each of the 5 ways of choosing the die that shows a 6, there are 5^4 possible combinations for the other dice. Let me compute that: 5^4 is 5 * 5 * 5 * 5. That's 25 * 25, which is 625. So, for each die chosen to show a 6, there are 625 ways the other dice can show non-6 numbers.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625. Let's do that math: 5 * 600 is 3000, and 5 * 25 is 125, so together, 3000 + 125 is 3125. So, 3125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my reasoning. So, we have 5 dice. We choose one die to be 6, which can happen in 5 ways. Then, the other four dice must each show 1-5, which is 5 choices each, so 5^4 = 625. Multiply those two together: 5 * 625 = 3125. That seems right. Is there another way to compute this?

Maybe I can think in terms of permutations or something else. For each die, the probability of getting a 6 is 1/6, and not getting a 6 is 5/6. Since the dice are independent, maybe I can use the binomial probability formula?

Yes, actually. The problem is similar to flipping coins and getting exactly one head in five flips, which is a classic binomial scenario. The probability is C(n, k) * (p)^k * (1-p)^(n - k).

Here, n = 5, k =1, p = 1/6, and (1 - p) = 5/6. So, plugging those into the formula: C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4. Calculating that:

C(5,1) is 5, as before.

(1/6) is about 0.1667.

(5/6)^4 is (approx 0.8333)^4. Let me compute that step by step:

(5/6)^2 = (25/36)

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it's often helpful to break down the problem using combinatorics. Maybe I can use combinations and probabilities of independent events?

First, let me recall that when rolling a die, the probability of getting a specific number, like a 6, is 1/6, and the probability of not getting a 6 is 5/6. Since the dice are independent, the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others. So, in this case, I'm rolling five dice, and I want exactly one of them to show a 6. The rest should show numbers other than 6.

So, how do I calculate the probability of this happening? I think it's a binomial probability problem because each die roll is a trial with two possible outcomes: success (rolling a 6) or failure (not rolling a 6). The binomial probability formula is:

P(k successes in n trials) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In this problem, n is 5 because we're rolling five dice, k is 1 because we want exactly one 6, p is 1/6, and (1-p) is 5/6.

So, plugging these into the formula, I get:

P = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, C(5, 1). I know that combinations are calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, plugging in the numbers:

C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 120 / (1 * 24) = 5.

Okay, so C(5, 1) is 5. That makes sense because there are five different dice, and any one of them could be the one showing a 6.

Next, (1/6)^1 is just 1/6.

Then, (5/6)^(5 - 1) is (5/6)^4. Let me calculate that. (5/6)^4 is (5^4)/(6^4). 5^4 is 625, and 6^4 is 1296. So, that's 625/1296.

So, putting it all together:

P = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, multiply 5 and (1/6):

5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

Then, multiply that result by (625/1296):

(5/6) * (625/1296) = (5 * 625) / (6 * 1296)

Calculating the numerator: 5 * 625 = 3125

Denominator: 6 * 1296. Let me compute 6*1296:

6 * 1000 = 6000

6 * 200 = 1200, so 6000 + 1200 = 7200

6 * 96 = 576

So, 7200 + 576 = 7776

So, the denominator is 7776.

So, now the probability is 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, let me check if that can be simplified. Let's see, 3125 and 7776.

3125 is 5^5, because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. So, 5^5.

7776 is 6^5, since 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, 6^5.

So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 6^5. Since 5 and 6 are coprime, there are no common factors, so the fraction 3125/7776 is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776.
