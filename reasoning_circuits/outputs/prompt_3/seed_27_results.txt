<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I've heard about probability problems involving multiple dice before, so maybe I can use some combinatorics here. Let me try to recall the formula or the method to solve it.

First, let's understand the problem: We're rolling five dice, and we want exactly one of them to show a 6. The other four should show something else, right? So, we need to figure out how many different ways this can happen, and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Alright, so each die has 6 faces, so rolling five dice would have 6^5 possible outcomes. Let me calculate that real quick. 6^5 is 6 multiplied by itself five times: 6×6×6×6×6. Let me compute that step by step:

6×6 = 36

36×6 = 216

216×6 = 1296

1296×6 = 7776

So, total possible outcomes are 7776. Got that.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes – that is, the number of ways to get exactly one 6 in five dice rolls. Hmm, this sounds like a combination problem because the order in which the 6 appears might not matter, but actually, in dice rolls, each die is distinct, so order does matter in a way. Wait, no, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to think in terms of selecting which die shows the 6 and the rest showing non-6.

So, first, how many ways can we choose which one die out of the five shows a 6? That's a combination of 5 dice taken 1 at a time, right? So, the number of ways is C(5,1).

Calculating that: C(5,1) is 5.

Okay, so there are 5 choices for which die shows the 6.

Now, for the chosen die, there's exactly 1 outcome that is 6.

For the remaining four dice, they must show something that's not 6. Each die can show numbers 1 through 5, so 5 possible outcomes each.

So, for each of the remaining four dice, there are 5 choices each.

Wait, so is this a permutation or combination here? Hmm, since each die is independent, it's just 5^4 for the remaining four dice.

Calculating that: 5^4 is 5×5×5×5.

5×5 = 25

25×5 = 125

125×5 = 625.

So, 625 possible outcomes for the non-6 dice.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose which die is 6 (which is 5) multiplied by the number of possible outcomes for the other dice (which is 625).

So, total favorable outcomes = 5×625.

5×625 = 3125.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

So, probability = 3125 / 7776.

Let me see if I can simplify that fraction or convert it to a decimal if needed.

But maybe that's already the simplest form. Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have a common divisor.

3125 is 5^5, right? 5×5×5×5×5 = 3125.

7776 is 6^5, which is (2×3)^5 = 2^5 ×3^5 = 32×243 = 7776.

So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5×3^5.

They don't share any common prime factors because 3125's factors are only 5s and 7776's factors are 2s and 3s. So, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Hmm, maybe we can leave it as a fraction or convert it to a decimal if the question prefers, but the problem just says "probability," so both forms are acceptable. But likely, they want the fraction.

So, probability is 3125/7776.

But just to be thorough, let me compute it as a decimal to see what value that is approximately. So, dividing 3125 by 7776.

Let me see: 3125 ÷ 7776.

First, I can note that 3125/7776 ≈ 0.4019 approximately.

Wait, how? Let me compute 3125 divided by 7776.

Let me compute 7776 × 0.4 = 3110.4

So, 0.

<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice would be 6^5, since each die has 6 sides and there are five dice. Let me write that down.

Total outcomes = 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, 6^5 is 7776. Got that.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, okay. So, I need exactly one die showing a 6, and the other four dice showing numbers other than 6. That makes sense.

So, how do I calculate the number of favorable outcomes? I think this is a combinatorics problem. It involves combinations because the order in which the dice show 6 doesn't matter. So, first, I need to choose which one of the five dice shows the 6. The number of ways to choose one die out of five is given by the combination formula C(n, k), which is n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, in this case, n is 5 and k is 1. Let me compute that.

C(5,1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1 * 4*3*2*1) = 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which die shows the 6.

Now, for each of the remaining four dice, they need to show a number that's not a 6. Since each die has numbers 1 through 6, and we don't want a 6, each of these four dice has 5 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, the number of possible outcomes for each of these four dice is 5. Since the dice are independent, the number of possible outcomes for all four dice together is 5^4.

Let me calculate 5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, 5^4 is 625.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose the die that shows 6 multiplied by the number of outcomes for the other dice. That is 5 * 625.

Wait, let me compute that: 5 * 625 is 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, is that the simplest form? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 3125 is 5^5, since 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. And 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5. They don't have any common prime factors, so the fraction 3125/7776 is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Total number of outcomes: 6^5 = 7776. That seems right.
2. Number of favorable outcomes: Choose 1 die out of 5 to show a 6, which is C(5,1)=5.
3. The other four dice must show numbers other than 6, so each has 5 possibilities: 5^4=625.
4. Multiply these together: 5*625=3125. That seems correct.
5. Probability is 3125/7776. Simplified, since they share no common factors, so that's the answer.

Wait, just to make sure, let me think about another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the binomial probability formula? Because each die roll is an independent trial with two outcomes: success (rolling a 6) or failure (rolling something else). So, the probability of exactly
