<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Since each die has six possible outcomes, the total number of outcomes is \(6^5 = 7776\).

Next, I calculate the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6. I choose which one of the five dice will show the 6, which can be done in \(5\) ways. For this selected die, there is only \(1\) outcome (rolling a 6). The remaining four dice must show a number other than 6. Each of these dice has \(5\) possible outcomes.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is \(5 \times 1 \times 5^4 = 5 \times 625 = 3125\).

Finally, I find the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes: \(\frac{3125}{7776}\).

To determine the probability of getting **exactly one 6** when rolling five dice, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Possible Outcomes

Each die has 6 possible outcomes. Since there are 5 dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[
6^5 = 7776
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Favorable Outcomes

We want **exactly one** of the five dice to show a **6**. 

1. **Choose which one die shows the 6:**
   \[
   \binom{5}{1} = 5
   \]
   
2. **Determine the outcomes for the chosen die:**
   \[
   1 \text{ (outcome: 6)}
   \]
   
3. **Determine the outcomes for the remaining four dice (they must not show a 6):**
   \[
   5 \text{ outcomes per die} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5^4 = 625
   \]
   
4. **Multiply the number of choices and outcomes:**
   \[
   5 \times 625 = 3125
   \]

### Step 3: Compute the Probability

The probability \( P \) is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Outcomes}} = \frac{3125}{7776}
\]

### Final Answer

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{3125}{7776}}
\]

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability questions like this often involve combinations and the multiplication principle. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, when rolling five dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes, right? So the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6. That's 6^5, which is 7776. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes in total.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. That means out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. So, I need to figure out how many ways this can happen and then divide that by the total number of outcomes to get the probability.

To find the number of favorable outcomes, I think I should use combinations. The number of ways to choose which one die shows a 6 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), which is n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 5 (since we have five dice) and k is 1 (because we want exactly one 6). So, C(5, 1) is 5. That means there are 5 different ways to get exactly one 6.

But wait, each of those ways isn't equally likely because the dice are independent. For each of these combinations, the other four dice need to show numbers that are not 6. Since each die has 5 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the number of outcomes for each of these four dice is 5. So, for each combination where one die is 6, the other four dice have 5 possibilities each. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 (from the combinations) multiplied by 5^4 (from the other dice). Let me calculate that: 5 * (5^4). 5^4 is 625, so 5 * 625 is 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 3125 / 7776. Hmm, is that the simplest form? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5, so 2^5 * 3^5. Since 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5, they don't share any common prime factors. So, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776. If I wanted to express this as a decimal or a percentage, I could do that, but the question just asks for the probability, so a fraction should be fine.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning. So, choosing which die shows the 6: 5 choices. Each of the other four dice has 5 possible outcomes each (1-5). So, 5 * 5^4 = 5^5 = 3125. Total outcomes: 6^5 = 7776. Yeah, that seems right. So, 3125 / 7776 is correct.

Another way to think about it: the probability of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 6 on a single die is 5/6. Since we want exactly one 6 in five dice, we can use the binomial probability formula. The formula is C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k). So, plugging in n = 5, k = 1, p = 1/6, we get C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(4). That's 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296). Calculating that: 5 * (625/1296) = 3125 / 1296. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right because 5 * 625 is 3125, and 1296 is 6^4. But our total number of outcomes is 6^5, which is 7776, not 1296.

Wait, I think I messed up something here. Let
