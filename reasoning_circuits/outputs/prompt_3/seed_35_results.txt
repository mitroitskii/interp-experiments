Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, when we talk about probability, especially with dice, it's usually about the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice would be the total number of different combinations we can get.

Each die has 6 faces, so for five dice, the total number of outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me just calculate that: 6 * 6 is 36, *6 is 216, *6 is 1296, *6 is 7776. So, 7776 total possible outcomes.

Alright, now I need to find how many of these outcomes have exactly one 6. That means out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. But to calculate that, I should think about how many ways this can happen.

I think this is a combinatorics problem where I need to consider two things: the number of ways to choose which die shows the 6, and the number of ways that the other dice can show numbers that are not 6.

So, the first part is the number of ways to choose one die out of five to be the one that shows 6. That's a combination problem, right? Because the order in which we choose the die doesn't matter. So, it's "5 choose 1," which is 5. I remember the formula for combinations is n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number and k is the number we want to choose. So, plugging in the numbers: 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1). A lot of cancellation here: the 4,3,2,1 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which die will show the 6.

Now, for the second part: the other four dice must show numbers that are not 6. Each die has 5 options instead of 6 (since we exclude 6). So, for each of the remaining four dice, there are 5 possible outcomes. That would be 5^4.

Let me compute 5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, 625 ways for the other four dice to show non-6 numbers.

Since these two parts are independent (the choice of which die shows 6 doesn't affect the outcome of the other dice), we can multiply the number of ways to choose the die by the number of ways the other dice can show non-6 numbers. So, that would be 5 * 625.

Let me do that multiplication: 5 * 625. Hmm, 5 * 600 is 3000, and 5 * 25 is 125. So, adding those together, 3000 + 125 = 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. That is 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, can I simplify that fraction? Let me see if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 3125 is 5^5 because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5. They don't have any common prime factors, so the fraction can't be simplified further. Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776.

But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. Let's go through the logic again. We need exactly one 6 in five dice. So, we have to choose which die shows the 6 (5 ways), and then the other four must show numbers other than 6, which means each has 5 possibilities, leading to 5^4. Multiplying them gives 5*5^4=5^5=3125. Then, divide by the total outcomes, which is 6^5=7776. So

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, when we talk about probability, especially with dice, it's often helpful to use combinations and probability rules. I remember that each die has six sides, numbered 1 through 6, and each side has an equal chance of landing face up. So, when rolling five dice, each die has a 1/6 chance of landing on a 6 and a 5/6 chance of not landing on a 6.

Now, I want exactly one of those five dice to show a 6. That means one die is a 6, and the other four are not. So, this sounds like a binomial probability problem because each die roll is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: success (rolling a 6) or failure (rolling something else).

In binomial probability, the formula is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In this case:
- n = 5 (since we're rolling five dice),
- k = 1 (we want exactly one 6),
- p = 1/6 (probability of rolling a 6 on a single die),
- (1-p) = 5/6 (probability of not rolling a 6 on a single die).

So, plugging these into the formula:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Let me break this down. First, I need to calculate C(5, 1). I remember that combinations can be calculated using the formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

Where "!" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, for C(5, 1):

C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = 5! / (1! * 4!) 

Calculating the factorials:

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
1! = 1

So, C(5, 1) = 120 / (1 * 24) = 120 / 24 = 5.

Okay, so C(5, 1) is 5. That makes sense because there are 5 different dice that could be the one showing a 6.

Next, let's compute (1/6)^1. That's just 1/6.

Then, (5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4. Let me calculate that. 

(5/6)^4 = (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6). Let's compute that step by step:

First, (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.

Then, 25/36 * 5/6 = 125/216.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 25/36 * 5/6 is actually (25*5)/(36*6) = 125/216. Hmm, actually, that's correct. So, (5/6)^4 is 125/216.

Wait, hold on, 5/6 to the fourth power is 625/1296? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.

Wait, 5^4 is 625, and 6^4 is 1296. So, yes, (5/6)^4 is 625/1296. But wait, earlier I thought 25/36 * 5/6 is 125/216. But 25/36 * 5/6 is (25*5)/(36*6) = 125/216, which is equal to 625/1296 when simplified. Wait, no, 125 * 6 = 750, and 216 * 6 = 1296, so 125/216 is equal to 750/1296. Hmm, so I think I messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, no, let me actually compute (5/6)^4 correctly.

(5/6)^1 = 5/
