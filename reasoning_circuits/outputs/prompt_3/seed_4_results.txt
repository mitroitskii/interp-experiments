Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that when dealing with probability involving multiple dice, it's usually about counting the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, let me recall, when you roll five dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes, right? So, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice is 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is \(6^5\). Let me calculate that:

\(6 \times 6 = 36\), \(36 \times 6 = 216\), \(216 \times 6 = 1296\), and \(1296 \times 6 = 7776\). So, the total number of possible outcomes is 7776. Got that part down.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out how many favorable outcomes there are—meaning how many ways can I get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, okay, so out of the five dice, only one should show a 6, and the other four should show numbers other than 6.

Let me break this down. First, I need to choose which one of the five dice will show the 6. The number of ways to choose which die is the 6 is equal to the number of dice, which is 5. So, that's 5 choices.

Now, once I've chosen which die is the 6, the remaining four dice need to show numbers other than 6. So, each of these four dice has 5 possible outcomes (since 1 through 5 and 7 through 6—wait, actually, hang on—let me double-check. Each die has numbers from 1 to 6, so if we're excluding 6, the number of possible outcomes for each of the remaining dice is 5. That seems right.

So, for each of the remaining four dice, there are 5 choices each. So, the number of possible outcomes for these four dice is \(5^4\). Let me calculate that: \(5^2 = 25\), \(25 \times 5 = 125\), \(125 \times 5 = 625\). So, 625 possible combinations for the other four dice.

So, putting it all together, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose the die that shows 6 multiplied by the number of ways the other dice can show non-6 numbers. That would be \(5 \times 625 = 3125\). Hmm, wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Hold on, I feel like there might be a mistake here. Let me go back through my reasoning. So, total possible outcomes: 6^5 = 7776. That seems right. Favorable outcomes: exactly one 6, so one die is 6, and the rest are not 6. So, for each die, the probability it's a 6 is 1/6, and the probability each of the other dice is not a 6 is 5/6.

But when we talk about counting favorable outcomes, it's a counting problem, not a probability yet. So, perhaps the number of favorable outcomes is indeed choosing 1 die out of 5 to be 6, and the rest being non-6. So, yeah, that's 5 choices for the 6, and for each of the remaining 4 dice, 5 choices each. So, 5 * 5^4. Let me calculate 5^4 first: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. Then, 5*625=3125. So, 3125 favorable outcomes.

So, probability is 3125 divided by total outcomes, which is 7776.

Hmm, let me express that as a fraction: 3125 / 7776. Is that reducible? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. Hmm, 3125 is 5^5, right? 5*5*5*5*5=3125. What about 7776? Let me factor that.

7776 divided by 6: 7776 / 6 = 1296. 1296 is 6^4, because 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296. So, 7776 = 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. So, 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 2^5 * 3

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that when dealing with probability involving multiple dice, it's often useful to consider each die as an independent event. Each die has 6 sides, numbered 1 through 6, and each number has an equal chance of appearing, right? So, the probability of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 6 is 5/6.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. That means out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the probability of this specific scenario happening.

I remember that for problems like this, where we're looking for a specific number of successes (in this case, rolling a 6) out of a total number of trials (rolling five dice), we can use the binomial probability formula. Let me recall what that formula is.

The binomial probability formula is given by:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- n is the total number of trials.

So, in our case:
- n = 5 (since we're rolling five dice),
- k = 1 (we want exactly one 6),
- p = 1/6 (the probability of rolling a 6 on a single die).

Let me plug these values into the formula.

First, let's compute C(5, 1). That's the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 to be the one showing a 6. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).

So, C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = 5! / (1! * 4!) 

Calculating that: 5! is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120, and 4! is 4*3*2*1 = 24. So, 120 / (1 * 24) = 5. Therefore, C(5, 1) is 5.

Next, p^k is (1/6)^1, which is just 1/6.

Then, (1 - p)^(n - k) is (5/6)^(5 - 1) = (5/6)^4.

So, putting it all together, P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4 = 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4.

Now, let me compute (5/6)^4. 5/6 to the power of 4 is (5/6)*(5/6)*(5/6)*(5/6). Let me calculate that step by step.

First, (5/6)^2 = (25/36). Then, (25/36)*(5/6) = 125/216. Finally, (125/216)*(5/6) = 625/1296.

So, (5/6)^4 = 625/1296.

Therefore, P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296). Let me compute that.

First, 5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

Then, 5/6 * 625/1296. Let me multiply the numerators: 5 * 625 = 3125. Then, the denominators: 6 * 1296. Let me calculate 6 * 1296.

6 * 1200 = 7200, and 6 * 96 = 576, so 7200 + 576 = 7776. So, the denominator is 7776.

Therefore, P(1) = 3125 / 7776.

Wait, let me confirm that multiplication step again. 5 * 625 is indeed 3125, and 6 * 1296 is 7776. So, the probability is 3125 over 7776.

Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

First, the combination part: C(5,1) is definitely
