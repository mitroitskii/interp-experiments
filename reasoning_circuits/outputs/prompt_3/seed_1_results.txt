<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I recognize that each die has an equal probability of landing on any of the six numbers from 1 to 6. Since we're rolling five dice, there are a total of 6 possible outcomes for each die, resulting in 6 raised to the power of 5, or 7776, total possible outcomes.

Next, I need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6. To achieve this, I should choose one die out of the five to show a 6. The number of ways to choose this die is given by the combination formula C(5, 1), which equals 5.

For the chosen die, there is only one favorable outcome (rolling a 6), and for the remaining four dice, they must show numbers other than 6. Each of these remaining dice has five possible outcomes. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for these dice is 5 raised to the power of 4, or 625.

Finally, I multiply the number of ways to choose the die by the number of favorable outcomes for the chosen die and the remaining dice. This gives me 5 multiplied by 625, which equals 3125.

Now, I calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. This results in 3125 divided by 7776, which simplifies to approximately 0.4019 or 40.19%.

To determine the probability of rolling exactly one 6 when rolling five dice, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Possible Outcomes:**
   
   Each die has 6 possible outcomes. When rolling five dice, the total number of outcomes is:
   
   \[
   6^5 = 7776
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Favorable Outcomes:**
   
   - **Choose which die shows the 6:** There are 5 dice, so the number of ways to choose one die is the combination \( C(5, 1) \), which equals 5.
   
   - **Outcomes for the Chosen Die:** The chosen die must show a 6, which has only 1 favorable outcome.
   
   - **Outcomes for the Remaining Dice:** Each of the remaining 4 dice must **not** show a 6. Each die has 5 possible outcomes (1-5), so:
   
     \[
     5^4 = 625
     \]
   
   - **Total Favorable Outcomes:** Multiply the number of ways to choose the die by the favorable outcomes for the chosen and remaining dice:
   
     \[
     5 \times 625 = 3125
     \]

3. **Calculate the Probability:**
   
   The probability \( P \) is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:
   
   \[
   P = \frac{3125}{7776} \approx 0.4019
   \]
   
   So, the probability is approximately **40.19%**.

\[
\boxed{\frac{3125}{7776} \approx 0.4019}
\]

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm just starting to learn about probability, so I might need to think carefully.

First, I know that when we roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? Each number from 1 to 6 has an equal chance of coming up, which is 1/6. So, if I roll five dice, each die is independent, meaning the outcome of one doesn't affect the others. That should be important.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. So, I need to think about all the possible ways this can happen. I remember something about combinations and permutations. Let me recall: combinations are when the order doesn't matter, and permutations are when it does. In this case, since I'm rolling dice, each die is distinct, but the specific numbers don't matter except for the count of 6s and non-6s. So, I think combinations might be the right approach here.

So, maybe I should use combinations to figure out how many ways I can have exactly one 6 in five dice. The number of ways to choose one die out of five to be a 6 is given by the combination formula, which is "5 choose 1." I think the formula for combinations is n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we want to choose. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!).

Let me compute that: 5! is 5 factorial, which is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. Then, 1! is just 1, and (5 - 1)! is 4!, which is 24. So, 120 / (1 × 24) = 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 different ways to get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. That makes sense because you could get the 6 on the first die, second, third, fourth, or fifth die.

Next, I need to figure out how many total possible outcomes there are when rolling five dice. Since each die has 6 possibilities, the total number of outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6 × 6 = 36; 36 × 6 = 216; 216 × 6 = 1296; 1296 × 6 = 7776. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Now, to find the probability, I need to take the number of favorable outcomes (which is the number of ways to get exactly one 6) divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that would be 5 / 7776.

Let me simplify that fraction. 5 and 7776 are both divisible by 5, so dividing numerator and denominator by 5 gives 1 / 1555.2. Wait, that doesn't look right because 7776 divided by 5 is 1555.2? Hmm, but probabilities should be in fractions with whole numbers, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, actually, 7776 divided by 5 is 1555.2, but since probabilities can be decimals, 5/7776 is approximately 0.000643, which is about 0.0643%. That seems really low, but considering there are five dice, the chance of getting exactly one 6 is indeed quite small.

Wait, let me double-check my math. 5 divided by 7776: 7776 ÷ 5 is 1555.2, so 5 ÷ 7776 is 1 ÷ 1555.2, which is approximately 0.000643. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I can express it as a fraction: 5/7776. Maybe I can simplify that fraction more? Let's see.

5 and 7776: 5 is a prime number, so I need to check if 5 divides into 7776. 7776 divided by 5 is 1555.2, which isn't an integer, so 5 is the only prime factor in the numerator. So, the fraction can't be simplified further. So, the probability is 5/7776.

Alternatively, if I want to express it as a decimal, it's approximately 0.000643, or 0.0643%. That seems really low, but considering that getting exactly one 6 is quite specific, it kind of makes sense
