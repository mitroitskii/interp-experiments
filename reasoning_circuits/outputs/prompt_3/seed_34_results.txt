Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, okay, I remember some basics about probability and dice, so maybe I can figure this out step by step. 

First, let me break down the problem. We have five dice, each with six sides. Rolling dice is a classic example of probability where each die is independent. So, each die has an equal chance of landing on any number from 1 to 6. Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. That means out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the other four show something else. 

Hmm, so I think I need to calculate how many possible favorable outcomes there are where exactly one die shows a 6, and the others don't. Then, divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. That should give me the probability.

Let me recall, when dealing with multiple independent events (like rolling dice), the total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of outcomes for each individual event. Since each die has 6 outcomes, rolling five dice should have 6^5 total possible outcomes. Let me calculate that: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. Wait, that seems like 6^5 is 7776. Yeah, so total outcomes are 7776.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes: getting exactly one 6. So, how do I compute that? Well, in probability, when dealing with exactly k successes (in this case, rolling a 6) in n trials (rolls), it's a binomial probability. The formula for exactly k successes is C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Since each die roll is independent, and each has the same probability.

Wait, yeah, that's the binomial probability formula. So, n is 5, k is 1, p is the probability of rolling a 6 on a single die. Since each die is fair, p=1/6. Let me write this down.

Number of favorable outcomes: C(5,1)*(1/6)^1*(5/6)^(5-1). So, that would be C(5,1)*(1/6)*(5/6)^4.

I think that's right because C(5,1) is the number of ways to choose which one die shows the 6, and then the remaining four dice must show something other than 6. Each of those four dice has a 5/6 chance of not being a 6. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is C(5,1)*(1/6)*(5/6)^4, and the total possible outcomes are 6^5, which is 7776.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is: for exactly one 6, you need to choose which die it is, times the probability that die shows 6, times the probability the others don't. Yep, same formula. So, to compute this, let me calculate each part step by step.

First, C(5,1) is 5. Because there are five dice, and any one of them can be the one that shows a 6. Then, (1/6) is the probability that the chosen die shows a 6. For the remaining four dice, each has a 5/6 chance of not being a 6, so (5/6)^4. Let me compute that.

Calculating (5/6)^4: (5/6)*(5/6)*(5/6)*(5/6). Let me do that step by step:

First, (5/6)*(5/6) = 25/36.

Then, (25/36)*(5/6) = 125/216.

Then, (125/216)*(5/6) = 625/1296.

So, putting it all together: 5*(1/6)*(625/1296). Let me compute this.

First, 5*(1/6) = 5/6. Then, 5/6*(625/1296).

Wait, but let me actually write it all as a single multiplication: 5*(1/6)*(625/1296) = (5 * 1 * 625) / (6 * 1296). So, 5*625 is 3125. And 6*1296: 1296*6. Let's compute that: 1000*6=6000, 200*6=1200, 90*6=540, 6*6=36. So adding

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it often involves combinations and the multiplication principle. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, when rolling five dice, each die has six possible outcomes, right? So, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me calculate that. 6 multiplied by itself five times: 6 * 6 = 36, 36 * 6 = 216, 216 * 6 = 1296, 1296 * 6 = 7776. So, there are 7,776 total possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Okay, that's my denominator for the probability.

Now, the numerator should be the number of favorable outcomes, which are the outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. So, how do I calculate that? I think I need to use combinations here. Specifically, the number of ways to choose which one die out of the five will show a 6.

The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we want to choose. In this case, n is 5 (since we have five dice) and k is 1 (because we want exactly one 6). Let me compute that: C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 5 / 1 = 5. So, there are 5 different ways that exactly one die can show a 6.

But wait, that's just the number of ways to choose which die shows the 6. For each of those choices, we also need to consider the outcomes for the other dice. The die that shows a 6 has only one possible outcome (since we're looking for exactly one 6), but the other four dice must show something other than 6. Each of those four dice has 5 possible outcomes (since they can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). 

So, for each of the 5 choices of which die is the 6, the other four dice each have 5 possible outcomes. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 (choices) multiplied by 5^4 (outcomes for the other dice). Let me calculate that: 5^4 is 625, right? Because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, 5 * 625 = 3125. Therefore, there are 3,125 favorable outcomes.

Wait, hold on. Is that right? Let me double-check. So, number of ways to choose the die that shows 6 is 5. For each such choice, the other four dice must show numbers other than 6. Each of those four dice has 5 possibilities, so 5^4 is indeed 625. So, 5 * 625 is 3125. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 3125 / 7776. Hmm, can that fraction be simplified? Let me see. Let's check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors.

3125 divided by 5 is 625. 7776 divided by 5 is 1555.2, which isn't an integer, so 5 isn't a common factor. Let's try 3: 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 11, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3125 isn't divisible by 3. 7776: 7 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 27, which is divisible by 3, so 7776 is divisible by 3, but 3125 isn't. So, they don't have 3 as a common factor.

What about 25? 3125 is 25^3, right? 25*25=625, 625*25=15625. Wait, no, 25^3 is 15625, which is more than 3125. Wait, 3125 is 5^5, because 5^5 is 3125. So, 5^5 is 3125. 7776 is
