<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First off, when dealing with probabilities involving multiple trials or dice in this case, it's often useful to use combinations and probability rules. I remember that in probability, when you have independent events, you can multiply the probabilities of each individual event. Also, since all the dice are fair, each has an equal chance of landing on any number, including 6.

So, let me break down the problem. We're rolling five dice, and we want exactly one of them to show a 6. That means one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. Since each die is independent, the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others.

I think I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes. That will give me the probability.

Starting with the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has 6 faces, so for five dice, it's 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6. 6^2 is 36, 6^3 is 216, 6^4 is 1296, and 6^5 is 7776. So the total number of possible outcomes is 7776. Okay, that part seems straightforward.

Now, for the favorable outcomes: exactly one 6 and four numbers that are not 6. First, how many ways can we get exactly one 6 in five dice? That's a combinatorial problem because the order matters here (since each die is distinct). The number of ways to choose which one die shows the 6 is equal to the number of combinations of 5 dice taken 1 at a time, which is 5 choose 1.

Calculating 5 choose 1: that's 5! / (1! * (5-1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) ) Wait, no, actually, the formula is 5! / (1!(5-1)!)= (120)/(1*24)=5. So there are 5 ways to choose which die shows the 6.

Okay, so 5 favorable arrangements. Now, for each such arrangement, how many favorable outcomes are there? For the chosen die, it must show a 6, which has only one outcome. For the remaining four dice, they need to show numbers other than 6. Since each die has 5 possible outcomes (1,2,3,4,5), each of these four dice has 5 choices.

Therefore, for each of the 5 arrangements, there are 1^1 (for the 6) multiplied by 5^4 (for the other four dice) possible outcomes. Calculating that, 5^4 is 625, so each arrangement has 625 outcomes.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625 = 3125.

Wait, let me verify that. So 5 ways to choose the die, and for each, 5^4 ways for the other dice, which is 625, so total is indeed 5 * 625 = 3125. That makes sense.

So now, putting it all together, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So that is 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, 3125 divided by 7776. I can also simplify this fraction if possible. Let me see if both numbers are divisible by any common factors.

3125 is 5^5, because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. Yep, so it's 5^5. 7776, well, I know that 6^5 is 7776, and 6 is 2*3, so 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5. So 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is (2*3)^5=2^5*3^5. So the fraction is (5^5)/(2^5 * 3^5). I don't think they have any common factors besides 1, so that's as simplified as it gets.

But let me just double-check my calculations because sometimes I might mess up somewhere.

So, total outcomes: 6^5=7776. That's correct because each die is independent, so each die has 6 possibilities, five dice

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple trials or dice, combinations and permutations come into play. Maybe I should use the binomial probability formula here?

Alright, so let's break it down. When you roll a die, the probability of getting a 6 is 1/6, and the probability of not getting a 6 is 5/6. Since we're dealing with five dice, and we want exactly one 6, this seems like a classic binomial scenario where each trial (die roll) has two outcomes: success (getting a 6) or failure (not getting a 6).

The binomial probability formula is given by:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- n is the number of trials.

In this case, n is 5 because we're rolling five dice. k is 1 because we want exactly one 6. p is 1/6, and (1-p) is 5/6.

So, plugging in the values, I should calculate C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1).

First, let me compute C(5,1). I know that combinations are calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, C(5,1) would be 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!).

Calculating that:

5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
1! = 1
4! = 24

So, C(5,1) = 120 / (1 * 24) = 120 / 24 = 5.

Okay, that makes sense because there are 5 different ways to get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Each way corresponds to which one of the five dice shows a 6.

Now, moving on to the next part of the formula: (1/6)^1. That's straightforward; it's just 1/6.

Then, we have (5/6)^(5-1) which is (5/6)^4. Let me compute that step by step.

First, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. Raising that to the fourth power:

(5/6)^4 = (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6)

Calculating each multiplication step by step:

First multiplication: (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944
Second multiplication: (25/36) * (5/6) = 125/216 ≈ 0.5787
Third multiplication: (125/216) * (5/6) = 625/1296 ≈ 0.4823

So, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

Now, putting it all together:

P(1) = C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4 = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296)

Wait, let me write that in fractions instead of decimals to be precise.

We have 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296). Let's compute this step by step.

First, multiply 5 and (1/6): 5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

Then, multiply that result by (625/1296):

(5/6) * (625/1296) = (5 * 625) / (6 * 1296) = 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, let me check if that reduces or if it can be simplified. 3125 and 7776, do they have any common factors?

Well, 3125 is 5^5, since 5^5 is 3125. 7776 divided by 6 is 1296, which is 6^4. 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5.

So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5. They don't share any common prime factors, so the fraction 312
