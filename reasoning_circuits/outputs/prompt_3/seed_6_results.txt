Okay, so I have this problem here: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First off, when rolling dice, each die is independent, right? So, each roll doesn't affect the others. I'm dealing with five dice, and I want exactly one of them to show a 6. Hmm. So, I think I need to calculate how many possible outcomes result in exactly one 6, and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Let me break it down.

Total number of possible outcomes: Well, each die has 6 faces, so for five dice, that's 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that:

6 * 6 = 36

36 * 6 = 216

216 * 6 = 1296

1296 * 6 = 7776

So, total outcomes = 7776.

Okay, that's the denominator of my probability. Now, for the numerator, I need the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to get exactly one 6.

To figure this out, I think combinations are involved here. Since I want exactly one die to show a 6, I need to choose which one of the five dice will show the 6. The rest of the dice should show something other than 6.

So, how do I calculate that?

I remember that in probability, when we have multiple independent events, the number of ways they can occur is found by the combination formula, which is:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)! )

Where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.

In this case, n is 5 (since there are five dice), and k is 1 (since we want exactly one 6). So, the number of ways to choose which die shows the 6 is:

C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) ) = 5 / 1 = 5.

So, there are 5 ways to choose which die shows the 6.

Now, for the remaining four dice, each one must show something other than a 6. Each die has 5 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). So, for each of those four dice, there's 5 possibilities, and since they are independent, we multiply the number of possibilities.

So, that's 5^4. Let me compute that:

5 * 5 = 25

25 * 5 = 125

125 * 5 = 625

So, 5^4 is 625.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose the die (which is 5) multiplied by the number of outcomes for the remaining dice (which is 625):

5 * 625 = 3125.

So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

Probability = 3125 / 7776

Let me see if this fraction can be simplified. Hmm, 3125 and 7776.

Breaking down 3125: It's 5^5, right? Because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125.

7776: Let's see. 6^5 is 7776, as I calculated earlier.

5 and 6 are coprime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Hmm, so is that the answer then? 3125/7776.

But maybe I should express this as a decimal or percentage to get a sense of it. Let me compute that.

3125 divided by 7776.

Well, let's do that step by step.

3125 ÷ 7776. Since 3125 is less than 7776, it's less than 1.

Let me estimate how much that is.

If I approximate, 7776 ÷ 3 is 2592. So, 3125 is a bit more than 2592. Wait, actually, 3125 is the numerator. Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to perform the division.

3125 ÷ 7776.

Multiply numerator and denominator by something to make it easier, but maybe

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving dice, each roll is independent, and each face has an equal chance of landing face up. Since we're rolling five dice, each die has six possible outcomes, right? So, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice should be 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5.

Let me calculate that: 6^5 is 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6. Hmm, 6 × 6 is 36, 36 × 6 is 216, 216 × 6 is 1296, and 1296 × 6 is 7776. So, there are 7,776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice. That seems right.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability of getting exactly one 6. So, I need to figure out how many ways this can happen. In probability terms, this is a binomial probability problem because each die roll is a trial with two possible outcomes: success (rolling a 6) or failure (rolling something else). But wait, actually, each die has six outcomes, but we're only considering one specific outcome (rolling a 6) as a success. So, yeah, binomial.

In binomial probability, the formula is:

P(k) = C(n, k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.
- p is the probability of success on a single trial.
- n is the number of trials.

In this case, n is 5 because we're rolling five dice. k is 1 because we want exactly one success (i.e., one 6). The probability of success p on a single die is 1/6, since there's one 6 on each die.

So, plugging the numbers into the formula:

First, let's calculate C(5, 1). That's the number of ways to choose 1 success out of 5 trials. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).

So, C(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (1 × (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)) = 120 / 24 = 5. Okay, that makes sense. There are five different dice, so we can get a 6 on any one of them, hence five different ways.

Next, p^k is (1/6)^1, which is just 1/6.

Then, (1 - p)^(n - k) is (5/6)^(5 - 1) = (5/6)^4.

So, putting it all together:

P(1) = C(5, 1) × (1/6)^1 × (5/6)^4 = 5 × (1/6) × (5/6)^4.

Now, let me compute (5/6)^4. That's (5/6) × (5/6) × (5/6) × (5/6). Let's calculate that:

First, (5/6)^2 is (25/36). Then, (25/36) × (25/36) is (625/1296). So, (5/6)^4 is 625/1296.

So, now, plug that back into the equation:

P(1) = 5 × (1/6) × (625/1296).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 5 × (1/6) is 5/6.

Then, 5/6 × 625/1296.

Multiplying those fractions: numerator is 5 × 625 = 3125, denominator is 6 × 1296 = 7776.

So, 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, let me see if that can be simplified. Let's check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors.

3125 is 5^5, because 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 3125.

7776 is 6^5, which is (2 × 3)^5 = 2^5 × 3^5.

So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 × 3^5. They don't have any
