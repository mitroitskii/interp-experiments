Okay, so I need to find the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that when we're dealing with probabilities involving multiple independent events, like rolling dice, the binomial probability formula is usually useful. Each die roll is an independent event with two possible outcomes: either a 6 or not a 6. But wait, actually, each die has six sides, right? So the possible outcomes are 1 through 6. But when I roll five dice and I'm interested in getting exactly one 6, it's similar to a success/failure scenario where success is rolling a 6 and failure is rolling anything else.

So, in this case, the probability of success (rolling a 6) on a single die is 1/6, and the probability of failure (not rolling a 6) is 5/6. Since each die is independent, the rolls of each die don't affect each other. Now, we're rolling five dice and want exactly one success (i.e., one 6) out of five trials.

I recall that the binomial probability formula is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes.
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.
- p is the probability of success on a single trial.
- n is the total number of trials.

So, in this problem:
- n = 5 (since we're rolling five dice)
- k = 1 (we want exactly one 6)
- p = 1/6
- 1 - p = 5/6

Plugging these into the formula, we should get:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, what is C(5, 1)? That's the number of ways to choose 1 success out of 5 trials. I remember that combinations are calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).

So, C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)) ). Wait, that simplifies.

I can see that in the numerator, we have 5 factorial, which is 120, and the denominator is 4 factorial, which is 24. So 120 divided by 24 is 5. So, C(5, 1) is 5. That makes sense because there are five different dice, and any one of them could be the one that shows a 6.

Next, (1/6)^1 is just 1/6. And then (5/6)^(5 - 1) is (5/6)^4.

Now, let's compute (5/6)^4. I can compute this step by step.

First, (5/6)^2 is (25/36). Then, squaring that again to get the fourth power:

(25/36)^2 = (625)/(1296).

Hmm, let me verify that multiplication:

25 * 25 = 625,

36 * 36 = 1296.

Yep, that's correct.

So, putting it all together:

P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296)

Multiplying these together.

First, multiply 5 and 1/6: 5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

Then, multiply that by 625/1296.

So, (5/6) * (625/1296) = (5 * 625) / (6 * 1296)

Calculating the numerator: 5 * 625 = 3125.

Denominator: 6 * 1296. Let me compute that.

1296 * 6: 1000*6=6000, 200*6=1200, 90*6=540, 6*6=36.

Adding them together: 6000 + 1200 = 7200, plus 540 is 7740, plus 36 is 7776.

So, denominator is 7776.

Therefore, the probability is 3125 / 7776.

Wait, let me check that again because 3125 divided by 7776 doesn't sound familiar to me. Let me see if I can reduce that fraction.

First, let's see if both numerator

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability questions often involve combinations and some sort of favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes. Let me break it down step by step.

First, when rolling five dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes, right? So the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice should be 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6*6*6*6*6. Hmm, 6^2 is 36, 6^3 is 216, 6^4 is 1296, and 6^5 is 7776. So, there are 7776 total possible outcomes.

Now, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to get exactly one 6 and the other four dice showing something other than 6. Okay, so I have five dice, and I want exactly one of them to show a 6. How do I calculate that?

I think this is a combinatorics problem. Specifically, I need to use combinations to determine how many ways one die can be a 6 and the other four can be non-6s. The number of ways to choose which one die shows the 6 is equal to the number of combinations of 5 dice taken 1 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.

So, C(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(1*(4*3*2*1)) = 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which die shows the 6.

Now, for each of those 5 choices, the chosen die must show a 6, and the remaining four dice must show something other than 6. Each of the remaining four dice has 5 possible outcomes (since they can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Therefore, for each of the four remaining dice, there are 5 possibilities.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for each of these 5 cases is 5^4. Let me compute that: 5*5*5*5 = 625. So, each of the 5 cases has 625 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625 = 3125.

So, putting it all together, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, let me see if I can simplify that fraction. Let's check the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3125 and 7776. 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. So, the prime factors of 3125 are only 5s, and the prime factors of 7776 are 2s and 3s. They have no common factors besides 1. So, the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776. If I want to write this as a decimal or a percentage, I can do that, but the question just asks for the probability, so the fraction form should be fine.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning. So, the total number of outcomes is 6^5 = 7776, correct. The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to have exactly one 6. That should be C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4. Wait, actually, now that I think about it, another way to compute the probability is using the binomial probability formula.

Yes, that's another approach. The probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, rolling a 6) in n trials (dice rolls) is given by C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n - k), where p is the probability of success on a single trial.

Here, n = 5, k = 1, p = 1/6. So, plugging in the numbers, it's C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4. We already calculated C(5,1) as 5, so that's 5 * (1/6) *
