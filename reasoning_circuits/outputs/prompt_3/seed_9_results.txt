<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple independent events, like rolling dice, it's often useful to think about combinations and probabilities multiplying. So, here's what I'm thinking.

When you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? Each number from 1 to 6 has an equal chance of coming up. So, the probability of rolling any specific number, like a 6, is 1/6. And the probability of not rolling a 6 would be 5/6 since there are five other numbers.

Now, the problem is asking about getting exactly one 6 out of five dice. So, this means that one die shows a 6, and the other four show something else. That makes sense. So, I need to figure out how likely this exact scenario is.

I remember from probability class that when we want to find the probability of a specific number of successes in multiple independent trials, we can use the binomial probability formula. The formula is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,
- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n trials taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- (1-p) is the probability of failure on a single trial.

Okay, so in this case:
- Our "success" would be rolling a 6,
- The number of dice rolled is 5, so n = 5,
- We want exactly one success, so k = 1,
- The probability of success, p, is 1/6,
- The probability of failure, (1-p), is 5/6.

Plugging these values into the formula, we should be able to calculate the probability.

First, let's calculate the combinations part, which is C(5,1). I remember that combinations are about choosing which trials are successful without considering the order. So, C(n,k) is calculated as n! / (k! * (n - k)!).

Calculating C(5,1):
5! is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120,
1! is just 1,
(5 - 1)! is 4! = 24.
So, C(5,1) = 120 / (1 * 24) = 5.

Okay, that makes sense because when you roll five dice, there are five different dice that could be the one showing the 6. So, five possible combinations.

Next, let's calculate p^k, which is (1/6)^1. That's just 1/6.

Then, (1 - p)^(n - k) is (5/6)^(5 - 1) = (5/6)^4.

Let me calculate (5/6)^4. Hmm, 5^4 is 625 and 6^4 is 1296. So, (5/6)^4 is 625/1296.

Now, putting it all together:

P(1) = C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4 = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 5 multiplied by (1/6) is 5/6.

Then, 5/6 multiplied by 625/1296.

Wait, maybe I should do it as fractions to keep it exact.

So, 5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

Now, 5/6 * 625/1296.

To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and denominators:

Numerator: 5 * 625 = 3125.

Denominator: 6 * 1296. Let me compute 6*1296.

1296 * 6: 1296 * 5 is 6480, plus 1296 is 7776. So, denominator is 7776.

So, we have 3125 / 7776.

Wait, does that simplify? Let's check.

3125 and 7776. Hmm, 3125 is 5^5, since 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125.

7776: Let's see, 7776 divided by 16 is 486, which isn't a power of 5. So, no, they don't share any common factors besides 1. So,

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it often helps to think in terms of combinations and permutations. Each die roll is an independent event, right? So each die has six possible outcomes, and they don't affect each other. That makes sense.

The question is about getting exactly one 6 out of five dice. So, I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That's the basic probability formula: Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes.

Let me break this down. The total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice is 6^5 because each die has 6 possibilities and the rolls are independent. Let me compute that real quick: 6*6*6*6*6. So, 6^5 is 7776. Got that.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to get exactly one 6 in five dice. So, I need to figure out how many different ways this can happen. I think this is a combinatorial problem where I need to choose which one of the five dice shows a 6.

To do that, I can use combinations. The number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 to be the 6 is "5 choose 1," which is denoted as C(5,1). The formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). So, plugging in the numbers: C(5,1) = 5! / (1! * (5-1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(1*4*3*2*1) = 5/1 = 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which die shows the 6.

But wait, that's just the number of ways to choose the die, but each die also has to show a 6, and the other dice have to show something that's not a 6. So, for the die that shows 6, it's fixed, but for the other four dice, each must show a number from 1 to 5. So, each of those four dice has 5 possible outcomes.

So, for each of these 5 choices of the die that shows 6, the other four dice each have 5 possibilities. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 (choices of die) multiplied by 5^4 (outcomes for the other dice). Let me compute that: 5 * 5^4. Since 5^4 is 625, so 5 * 625 is 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is 3125 / 7776. Hmm, that fraction can probably be simplified. Let me check: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 13? Let's see, 3125 divided by 13 is approximately 240.38, which isn't an integer. How about 5? 3125 divided by 5 is 625, and 7776 divided by 5 is 1555.2, which isn't an integer. So, maybe 3125 and 7776 share a common factor of something else.

Wait, 3125 is 5^5, right? Because 5*5*5*5*5 is 3125. And 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5, so 2^5 * 3^5. So, the prime factors of 3125 are just 5s, and the prime factors of 7776 are 2s and 3s. So, there are no common factors besides 1. Therefore, the fraction 3125/7776 is already in its simplest form.

But just to make sure, let me think again. 3125 divided by 5 is 625, and 7776 divided by 5 is not an integer, so yes, they don't share any common factors. So, the probability is 3125/7776.

Alternatively, if I want to express this as a decimal or a percentage, I could do that, but the problem doesn't specify, so a fraction is probably fine.

Wait, let me just double-check my reasoning. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5, which is 7776. That's correct. For exactly one 6, we choose which die it is, which is 5 choices, and then the other four dice must be numbers from 1-5, so 5^4
