Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that probability problems often involve combinations and some counting. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, when you roll dice, each die has six sides, numbers 1 through 6, right? So, when you roll one die, the probability of getting a 6 is 1/6, and the probability of not getting a 6 is 5/6. But here, we have five dice, and we need exactly one 6 among them. So, I think this is a binomial probability problem because each trial (rolling a die) is independent, and we want a specific number of successes (in this case, getting a 6 exactly once) out of a certain number of trials.

Yes, binomial probability. The formula for binomial probability is: 

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- and (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In our case, n is 5 (since we have five dice), k is 1 (we want exactly one 6), p is 1/6 (probability of rolling a 6), and (1-p) is 5/6 (probability of rolling something other than a 6).

So, let me compute this step by step.

First, let's compute C(5, 1). That's the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 to be the one that shows a 6. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).

Calculating that:

C(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 120 / 24 = 5.

So, there are 5 ways to get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. That makes sense, because any one of the five dice could be the one that shows a 6.

Next, let's compute p^k, which is (1/6)^1. That's just 1/6.

Then, (1 - p)^(n - k) is (5/6)^(5 - 1) = (5/6)^4. Let me calculate that:

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296.

Wait, let me compute 5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625.

And 6^4: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296. Yes, that's correct.

So, putting it all together:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4 = 5 * (1/6) * (625 / 1296).

Hmm, okay. So first, let's compute 5 * (1/6). That's 5/6.

Then, multiplying that by 625/1296: (5/6) * (625/1296).

Let me compute 5*625 first. 5*625 = 3125.

Then, the denominators: 6*1296. Let's compute 6*1296. 6*1200 = 7200, 6*96 = 576, so total is 7200 + 576 = 7776.

So, P(1) = 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, is that in the simplest form? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 3125 is 5^5, which is 3125. 7776 divided by 3125? Let me see: 3125 * 2 = 6250, subtract that from 7776: 7776 - 6250 = 1526. Hmm, not divisible by 5.

Wait, maybe I should factor both.

Wait, 7776. Let me see: 7776 divided by 6 is 1296, as before. 1296 divided by 6 is 216, then divided by 6 is 36, divided by 6 is 6, divided by

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it often involves combinations and some understanding of how each die behaves independently. 

First, I need to recall how probability works for dice. Each die has 6 faces, numbers 1 through 6, each equally likely to come up. So, the probability of getting a 6 on a single die is 1/6, and the probability of not getting a 6 is 5/6. Since the dice are independent, the outcome of one doesn't affect the others.

Now, the problem is about getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. That means out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. So, I think this is a binomial probability problem because we're looking for the number of successes (getting a 6) in a fixed number of independent trials (dice rolls), where each trial has two possible outcomes: success or failure.

In the binomial probability formula, the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, p is the probability of success on a single trial, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In this case, n is 5 because we're rolling five dice. k is 1 because we want exactly one 6. The probability of success, p, is 1/6, and the probability of failure, (1-p), is 5/6.

So, plugging these into the formula, we get:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, C(5, 1). I remember that combinations are calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, C(5, 1) is 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)! ) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) ) = 5 / 1 = 5. Okay, so that part is 5.

Next, (1/6)^1 is just 1/6. That's straightforward.

Then, (5/6)^(5 - 1) is (5/6)^4. Hmm, I need to calculate that. Let me compute (5/6)^4. 

First, (5/6)^2 is 25/36. Then, squaring that again, (25/36)^2 is 625/1296. So, (5/6)^4 is 625/1296.

Now, putting it all together:

P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296)

Let me compute that. First, multiply 5 and (1/6):

5 * (1/6) = 5/6

Then, multiply that by 625/1296:

(5/6) * (625/1296) = (5 * 625) / (6 * 1296)

Calculating numerator: 5 * 625 = 3125

Denominator: 6 * 1296. Let me compute 6 * 1296:

1296 * 6: 1000*6=6000, 200*6=1200, 90*6=540, 6*6=36. So, 6000 + 1200 = 7200; 7200 + 540 = 7740; 7740 + 36 = 7776.

So, denominator is 7776.

Therefore, P(1) = 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, let me check if that fraction can be simplified. Let's see, 3125 and 7776.

3125 is 5^5, because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125.

7776: Let me factorize that. 7776 divided by 6 is 1296, which we know is 6^4 (since 6*6=36, 36*36=1296). So, 7776 = 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^
