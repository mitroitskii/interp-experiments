<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To determine the probability of rolling exactly one six when rolling five dice, I first need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has six sides, so with five dice, the total number of outcomes is 6 raised to the power of 5, which equals 7776.

Next, I'll identify the number of favorable outcomes. This involves selecting one die to show a six and the remaining four dice showing numbers other than six. I can choose which one die shows a six in 5 ways. For each of these choices, the other four dice each have 5 possible outcomes (since they can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 multiplied by 5 raised to the power of 4, which equals 5 × 625 = 3125.

Finally, I'll calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes: 3125 divided by 7776. This simplifies to 3125/7776, which cannot be reduced further.

To determine the probability of rolling exactly one 6 when rolling five dice, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Total Number of Possible Outcomes:**
   - Each die has 6 faces (1 through 6).
   - When rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is \(6^5 = 7776\).

2. **Calculate the Number of Favorable Outcomes:**
   - We want exactly one die to show a 6.
   - **Step 1:** Choose which one of the five dice will show a 6. There are \( \binom{5}{1} = 5 \) ways to do this.
   - **Step 2:** For the remaining four dice, none should show a 6. Each of these dice has 5 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
     - Therefore, there are \(5^4 = 625\) ways for the remaining four dice.
   - **Total Favorable Outcomes:** \(5 \times 625 = 3125\).

3. **Determine the Probability:**
   - Probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{3125}{7776}
   \]
   
4. **Simplify the Fraction (if possible):**
   - Both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 625.
   \[
   \frac{3125 \div 625}{7776 \div 625} = \frac{5}{12.4416}
   \]
   - However, for simplicity, we can leave the fraction as \( \frac{3125}{7776} \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{3125}{7776}}
\]

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it's often useful to consider each die as an independent event. Each die has six possible outcomes, right? So when rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me calculate that real quick: 6*6*6*6*6. That's 7776 total possible outcomes. So, the sample space has 7776 equally likely outcomes.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. So, I need to figure out how many different ways this can happen. That is, how many different outcomes result in exactly one 6 and four non-6s.

Since each die is independent, I can use combinations to figure out how many ways one die can be a 6 and the other four can be something else. The number of ways to choose which one die is the 6 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), which is n! / (k!(n - k)!). In this case, n is 5 (since there are five dice) and k is 1 (because we want exactly one 6).

Calculating that: C(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1*4*3*2*1) = 5. So, there are 5 different ways to have exactly one 6.

But wait, it's not just about choosing which die is the 6; we also need to consider what the other four dice show. Each of those four dice can't be a 6, so they can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. That's five possible outcomes for each die. Since the dice are independent, the number of possible outcomes for the four non-6 dice is 5^4.

Let me compute 5^4: 5*5*5*5 = 625. So, for each of the 5 choices of the die that shows a 6, there are 625 possible outcomes for the other dice.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625. Let me calculate that: 5*625 = 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Now, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, can this fraction be simplified? Let me check. 3125 and 7776. 3125 is 5^5, right? Because 5*5*5*5*5 is 3125. And 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5. They don't share any common factors besides 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776.

Wait, let me just double-check my reasoning. So, each die is independent, and we're looking for exactly one success (rolling a 6) out of five trials (dice). This sounds like a binomial probability problem.

In the binomial formula, the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k). Here, n is 5, k is 1, and p is 1/6 (since each die has a 1/6 chance of rolling a 6).

Plugging those numbers in: C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4. Let me compute that. C(5, 1) is 5, as before. (1/6)^1 is 1/6, and (5/6)^4 is (625/1296). So, multiplying them together: 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296).

Wait a minute, hold on. That seems a bit different from what I had before. Let me compute this step by step.

First, 5 * (1/6) = 5/6. Then, 5/6 * (625/1296). Let me compute 5/6 * 625/1296.

Multiplying the numerators: 5 * 625 = 3125.
