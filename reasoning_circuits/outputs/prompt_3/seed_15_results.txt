Alright, so I’ve got this probability problem here: What’s the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, okay. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving dice, each roll is independent, and each die has six possible outcomes, right? So, when rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me calculate that real quick: 6 multiplied by itself five times. That’s 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, 6^5 is 7776 total possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Got that down.

Now, the question is asking about the probability of getting exactly one 6. So, I need to figure out how many different ways this can happen and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 7776.

Okay, so how do I figure out the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6? Hmm, this sounds like a combinatorics problem. I think it involves combinations and maybe something with probability principles.

Let me recall the formula for probability. Probability is usually the number of favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes. So, probability P = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes). We already have the total, which is 7776. So, we just need the number of favorable outcomes.

To get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice, I need to consider that one die shows a 6, and the other four dice show numbers other than 6. So, let me think about how to count these.

First, I need to choose which one of the five dice shows the 6. How many ways can this happen? That should be a combination problem since the order in which we choose the dice doesn’t matter. So, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of dice, which is 5, and k is the number of successful outcomes, which is 1.

Let me compute that: C(5,1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1*4*3*2*1) = 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 different ways to have exactly one 6 in five dice.

Alright, that takes care of choosing which die shows the 6. Now, the remaining four dice need to show something other than a 6. Each die has 5 possible outcomes (since 1 through 5 and 6 isn't allowed). So, for each of the remaining four dice, there are 5 choices.

Therefore, for each of these combinations where one die is a 6 and the others are not, there are 5^4 possible outcomes. Let me compute that: 5^4 is 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, 625 possible outcomes for the remaining four dice.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose which die is the 6 multiplied by the number of ways the other dice can be non-6. That is 5 (from the combinations) multiplied by 625 (from the possibilities of the other dice). So, 5*625=3125.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 3125.

So, putting it all together, the probability P is 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, let me see if that fraction can be simplified. Let's check the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3125 and 7776.

First, factorize 3125: 3125 divided by 5 is 625, divided by 5 again is 125, then 25, then 5. So, it's 5^5.

Now, 7776: I know that 7776 is 6^5. Let me confirm: 6^1=6, 6^2=36, 6^3=216, 6^4=1296, 6^5=7776. So, it's 2^5 * 3^5.

So, 3125 is 5^5, 7776 is (2*3)^5=2^5*3^5. So, they don't share any common prime factors besides 1. So, the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776.

Wait, hold on, is that the correct number? Let me double-check my

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability questions often involve combinations and maybe some permutations, but I need to be careful here.

First, let me recall that when we're dealing with dice, each die has six possible outcomes, right? So, when rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6*6*6*6*6. That's 7776. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 7776.

Now, the question is asking for the probability of getting exactly one 6. So, that means out of the five dice, one die shows a 6 and the other four show numbers other than 6. Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out how many ways this can happen and then divide that by the total number of outcomes, which is 7776.

To find the number of favorable outcomes, I should use combinations because the order in which the 6 appears doesn't matter. That is, it doesn't matter which specific die shows the 6; all that matters is that exactly one die does. So, the number of ways to choose which die shows the 6 is "5 choose 1", which is written as C(5,1).

Let me compute that: 5 choose 1 is 5. So, there are 5 different ways this can happen.

Now, for each of these ways, the die that shows 6 has only one possible outcome, which is 6. But the other four dice need to show numbers that are not 6. Each of these four dice has 5 possible outcomes (since they can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). So, for each of those four dice, there are 5 choices.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for each specific die showing a 6 is 5^4. Let me compute that: 5*5*5*5 is 625. So, for each of the 5 choices of which die shows a 6, there are 625 possible outcomes for the other dice.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625. Let me calculate that: 5*625 is 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, for each die, the number of ways the other four can not be 6 is 5^4, which is 625. And since there are 5 dice, each could be the one that shows 6, so 5*625 is indeed 3125. That seems right.

So, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that would be 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, can I simplify that fraction? Let me see. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by... let's check. 3125 is 5^5, right? Because 5*5*5*5*5 is 3125. And 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5, so 2^5 * 3^5. So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is (2*3)^5. They don't have any common factors besides 1, I think. So, the fraction cannot be simplified further.

So, the probability is 3125/7776. Hmm, I wonder if that can be expressed as a decimal or a percentage? Well, the question just asks for the probability, so either fraction or decimal is fine, but probably fraction is preferable here.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the logic again. The total number of outcomes is 6^5, which is correct. For exactly one 6, we need to choose which die shows 6, which is 5 choose 1, that's 5. Then, for the chosen die, it's fixed as 6, and the other four dice have 5 choices each, so 5^4. Multiply those together, 5*625, which is 3125. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is: the probability of getting exactly one 6 is equal to the number of ways to have one 6 and four non-6s. So, the formula for this is C(n, k) * (p)^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success on a single trial.
