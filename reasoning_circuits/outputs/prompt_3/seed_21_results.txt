<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when I roll five dice. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, when we talk about probability, it's usually the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the successful outcomes are the ones where exactly one of the five dice shows a 6. The total possible outcomes would be all the different combinations you can get when rolling five dice.

Let me start by calculating the total number of possible outcomes. Since each die has 6 faces, and the dice are independent, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice should be 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me write that down:

Total outcomes = 6^5.

Calculating that, 6^5 is 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6. Let me compute that:

6*6 is 36,
36*6 is 216,
216*6 is 1296,
1296*6 is 7776.

So, total outcomes = 7776. That makes sense because each die has 6 possibilities and there are five dice.

Now, the successful outcomes are those where exactly one die shows a 6. Hmm, how do I calculate that?

I think this is a combinatorial problem. I need to figure out how many ways exactly one die can show a 6. The other four dice shouldn't show a 6.

Let me break it down. First, how many ways can exactly one die be a 6? Well, since there are five dice, I can choose one die out of five to show the 6. The number of ways to choose which die is a 6 is given by the combination formula "5 choose 1".

The combination formula "n choose k" is n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where "n!" stands for n factorial, which is n multiplied by (n - 1) until we get to 1.

So, "5 choose 1" is 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)! ) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) ) = 5 / 1 = 5.

So, there are 5 different ways to have exactly one die show a 6. Each of these ways corresponds to which die is the 6.

But wait, that's not the entire picture. For each of these choices, the die that shows a 6 has only one possible outcome (it must show a 6), but the other four dice must not show a 6. Each of these four dice has 5 possible outcomes (since they can show 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).

So, for each of the 5 ways to choose the die that shows a 6, there are 5^4 possible outcomes for the remaining four dice.

Therefore, the number of successful outcomes is the number of ways to choose which die is the 6 multiplied by the number of outcomes for the other dice.

That is: successful outcomes = 5 * 5^4.

Calculating that:

First, 5^4 is 5*5*5*5. Let me compute that.

5*5 is 25,
25*5 is 125,
125*5 is 625.

So, 5^4 is 625.

Then, multiplying that by 5: 5 * 625 = 3125.

So, there are 3125 successful outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Therefore, the probability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, can this fraction be simplified? Let me check.

3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5. Let me write that:

3125 = 5^5,
7776 = 6^5.

So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 6^5. There are no common factors between 5 and 6, so the fraction cannot be reduced further.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776.

But maybe I should write this as a decimal or a percentage to make it clearer. Let me try dividing 3125 by 7776.

Calculating that:

3125 ÷ 7776 ≈ 0.401877...

So, approximately 0.4019, which is about 40.19%.

That seems reasonable. To double-check, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose we had only 1 die; the probability of getting exactly one

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability problems often involve combinations and maybe something with binomial coefficients. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, when you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? Each face from 1 to 6. So, when rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6. Hmm, 6^5 is 7776. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 7776. That's good to know.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. So, I need to figure out how many different ways this can happen. I think this is where combinations come into play. Since we're dealing with exactly one success (rolling a 6) out of five trials (dice rolls), we can use combinations to determine the number of favorable outcomes.

The number of ways to choose one die out of five to be the 6 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), which is n! / (k!(n - k)!). In this case, n is 5 and k is 1. So, C(5,1) is 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!). Calculating that: 5! is 120, and 1! is 1. So, 120 / (1 × 24) which is 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which one die shows a 6.

But wait, that's just the number of ways to choose the die that shows a 6. The other four dice need to show something that's not a 6. Each of those four dice has 5 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). So, for each of those four dice, there are 5 choices. That means for the four non-6 dice, the number of possible outcomes is 5^4.

Let me calculate 5^4: 5 × 5 × 5 × 5. That's 25 × 25, which is 625. So, each of the four non-6 dice has 625 possible outcomes? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each die has 5 possibilities, so for four dice, it's 5 multiplied four times, which is 5^4, which is indeed 625. So, each of the four non-6 dice contributes a factor of 5 to the total number of outcomes.

So, putting it all together, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose the die that shows a 6 (which is 5) multiplied by the number of ways the other four dice can show non-6 numbers (which is 5^4 or 625). So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 × 625.

Let me calculate that: 5 × 625. Well, 625 × 5 is 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 3125 / 7776. Hmm, can this fraction be simplified? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors.

3125 is 5^5, because 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 is 3125. 7776 is 6^5, which is (2 × 3)^5, so that's 2^5 × 3^5. So, the prime factors of 3125 are only 5s, and the prime factors of 7776 are 2s and 3s. There are no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776. If I want to express this as a decimal, I can divide 3125 by 7776. Let me do that calculation. Hmm, 3125 ÷ 7776. Let me see, 7776 ÷ 3125 is approximately 2.5, so 3125 ÷ 7776 is about 0.403. So, approximately 40.3%.

Wait, let me verify that division. Maybe I can do it more accurately.

3125 divided by 7776. Let me set it up as a division problem:
