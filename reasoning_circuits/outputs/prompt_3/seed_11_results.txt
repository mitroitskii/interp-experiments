<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to probability, so I might need to think carefully.

First, when rolling dice, each die is independent, right? That means the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others. So, when rolling five dice, each has an equal chance of landing on numbers from 1 to 6. Hmm, okay. So, each die has 6 possible outcomes.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. That means out of the five dice, one should show a 6, and the other four should show numbers other than 6, like 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Right, so I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6 and the rest show something else, and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Let me write that down. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the formula would be:

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

Alright, now, what's the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice? Well, since each die has 6 possibilities, and the dice are independent, I should multiply the number of outcomes for each die together. So, that would be 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6. Let me calculate that. 6^5. Hmm, 6*6 is 36, 36*6 is 216, 216*6 is 1296, and 1296*6 is 7776. So, total number of possible outcomes is 7776. Got that.

Now, number of favorable outcomes. So, favorable outcomes are the ones where exactly one die is a 6, and the others are not. How do I count that?

I remember that in combinatorics, when we want to count the number of ways to choose a certain number of successes (in this case, getting a 6) out of a total number of trials (the five dice), we can use combinations. So, the number of ways to choose which one die out of the five will show a 6 is equal to the number of combinations of 5 dice taken 1 at a time.

The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of trials, and k is the number of successes. So, here, n is 5, and k is 1. Let me calculate that.

C(5,1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1). Wait, but 5! is 120 and 1! is 1, so it simplifies to 120 / (1 * 24) = 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which one die will show a 6. That makes sense since each die has an equal chance.

Now, for each of these 5 choices, the one die showing a 6 can be any one of the five dice, right? So, each of those 5 choices corresponds to a different die being the one that shows the 6.

But for each such choice, the other four dice must show something other than 6. Each of these four dice has 5 possible outcomes (since numbers 1-5 are the non-6 numbers). So, for each of the four dice, there are 5 possibilities each.

Therefore, for each of the 5 choices where one die is a 6, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (for the 6) multiplied by 5^4 (for the other four dice). Let me check that. For one specific die showing a 6, the other four each have 5 choices, so 5^4 is 625.

Wait, but then since there are 5 different dice that could be the one showing the 6, each contributing 625 outcomes, the total number of favorable outcomes would be 5 * 625, which is 3125. Let me verify that.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: for each die, the probability of it being a 6 and the others not is (1/6) * (5/6)^4. Since there are five dice, I can multiply this probability by 5. But hold on, is that the number of favorable outcomes or the probability? Hmm

<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to probability, so I might need to think carefully.

First, when rolling dice, each die has six sides, numbered 1 through 6. So, when rolling five dice, each die has an equal chance of landing on any number from 1 to 6. Since the dice are independent, the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. So, out of the five dice, I want one of them to show a 6, and the other four to show something else, right? That something else can't be a 6 because we're looking for exactly one. So, each of the other four dice must show either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Hmm, okay. So, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. Binomial because we have a fixed number of independent trials (in this case, five dice), each with two possible outcomes (success or failure, where success is rolling a 6 and failure is rolling something else). Yeah, that seems right.

The formula for binomial probability is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In this case, n is 5 because we're rolling five dice. k is 1 because we want exactly one 6. p is the probability of rolling a 6 on a single die, which is 1/6. And (1-p) is the probability of not rolling a 6, which is 5/6.

So, plugging the numbers into the formula, we should get the probability.

First, let's compute C(5, 1). That's the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 to be the one showing a 6. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).

So, C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 ways to get exactly one 6.

Next, p^k is (1/6)^1 = 1/6. Then, (1-p)^(n - k) is (5/6)^(5 - 1) = (5/6)^4. Let me calculate that.

(5/6)^4 is equal to (5^4)/(6^4). 5^4 is 625, and 6^4 is 1296. So, that's 625/1296.

Now, putting it all together: P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4 = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 5 * (1/6) is 5/6.

Then, 5/6 * 625/1296.

Multiplying the numerators: 5 * 625 = 3125.

Multiplying the denominators: 6 * 1296 = 7776.

So, that gives us 3125/7776.

Hmm, can this fraction be simplified? Let's see.

3125 and 7776. Let's check if they have any common factors.

3125 is 5^5, because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. So, 5^5.

7776, let's see. 7776 divided by 6 is 1296, which we already know. 1296 divided by 6 is 216, divided by 6 is 36, divided by 6 is 6, divided by 6 is 1. So, 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5.

So, 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 2^5 * 3
