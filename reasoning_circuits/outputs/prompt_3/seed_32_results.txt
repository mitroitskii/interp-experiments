Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple trials (like rolling dice), each roll is an independent event. That means the outcome of one roll doesn't affect the others. Each die has six possible outcomes, right? So when rolling five dice, there are a total of \(6^5\) possible outcomes. Let me calculate that to have a concrete number. 

\(6^5 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 7776\). So, there are 7,776 total possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Got that down.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. That means out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where this happens and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes to get the probability.

To find the number of favorable outcomes, I think I should use combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection doesn't matter, and in this case, we're selecting which one of the five dice shows the 6. So, how many ways can we choose one die out of five to be the 6?

That's the combination formula: \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \). Plugging in the numbers here, \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 1 \). Let me compute that:

\( C(5, 1) = \frac{5!}{1!(5 - 1)!} = \frac{5!}{1!4!} \). Now, \(5! = 120\) and \(4! = 24\), so:

\( \frac{120}{1 \times 24} = \frac{120}{24} = 5 \). So, there are 5 ways to choose which die will show the 6.

Now, for each of those 5 choices, the die that isn't showing a 6 needs to show something else. Since a die has numbers 1 through 6, and we're excluding 6, each of the remaining four dice has 5 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). So, for each of those 5 choices of which die is 6, the other four dice each have 5 possibilities.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose which die is 6 multiplied by the number of possibilities for the other dice. That is \(5 \times 5^4\). Let me compute that:

\(5 \times 5^4 = 5 \times 625 = 3125\). Wait, no, hold on: \(5^4 = 625\), so 5 times 625 is 3,125. Hmm, is that right? Let me verify:

5^4 is 5*5*5*5 = 25*25 = 625. Then, 5*625 is indeed 3,125. Okay, that seems correct.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is 3,125.

Now, to find the probability, I divide that by the total number of possible outcomes. We already calculated the total as 7,776. So, probability \(P = \frac{3125}{7776}\).

I should check if this fraction can be simplified. Let's see, both numerator and denominator are divisible by... Let me see if they have any common factors. Let's factorize 3125 and 7776.

3125 divided by 5 is 625. 625 divided by 5 is 125, and then 125 divided by 5 is 25, then 25 divided by 5 is 5, and 5 divided by 5 is 1. So, 3125 is \(5^5\).

7776 divided by 6 is 1296. 1296 divided by 6 is 216, then 216 divided by 6 is 36, and then 36 divided by 6 is 6, and 6 divided by 6 is 1. So, 7776 is \(6^5\), which can be written as \( (2 \times 3)^5 = 2^5 \times 3^5 \).

Now, looking at the prime factors, 3125 is \(5^5\) and 7776 is \(2^5 \times 3^5\). There are no common prime

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about combinations and probabilities from my math classes, so maybe I can use that here.

First, when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, each die roll is an independent event. That means the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others. Each die has six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, when rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, there are 7,776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Now, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to get exactly one 6 and four numbers that are not 6. So, how do I calculate that? I think it involves combinations because the order in which the numbers appear matters, but since we're just counting the number of favorable outcomes, we can use combinations to figure out how many ways this can happen.

First, I need to choose which one of the five dice shows a 6. The number of ways to choose one die out of five is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, in this case, n=5 and k=1. Let me compute that: 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!)= (5*4*3*2*1)/(1*4*3*2*1)= 120 / 24=5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which die shows the 6.

Next, for the remaining four dice, each of them must show a number that's not a 6. Since each die has 5 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the number of favorable outcomes for each of these dice is 5. Since these are independent events, I can multiply the number of favorable outcomes for each die together. So, for four dice, it would be 5^4. Let me calculate that: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, there are 625 favorable outcomes for the non-6 dice.

Now, to get the total number of favorable outcomes for exactly one 6, I need to multiply the number of ways to choose the die that shows 6 by the number of favorable outcomes for the other dice. That would be 5 (from the combinations) multiplied by 625 (from the non-6 outcomes). Let me do that: 5*625=3125. So, there are 3,125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6 and the others show numbers other than 6.

Wait, let me double-check that. If I have five dice, and I choose one to be a 6, that's 5 choices. Then, the other four dice each have 5 choices (since they can't be 6). So, 5*5^4=5*625=3125. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that would be 3125 divided by 7776. Let me write that as a fraction: 3125/7776.

Hmm, can this fraction be simplified? Let's see. Both numbers end with 5 and 6, respectively. Let me check if they have any common factors. 3125 is 5^5, right? Because 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. So, 5^5. 7776, on the other hand, let's factor that. I know that 7776 divided by 6 is 1296, which is 6^4. So, 7776=6^5= (2*3)^5=2^5*3^5. So, 7776=2^5 * 3^5.

Since 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5, they don't share any common prime factors. So, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776.

If I want to write this as a decimal
