<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, when dealing with probability, especially with multiple dice, it often involves combinatorics. Each die is an independent event, right? So the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others. That helps because I can use the multiplication rule for independent events.

Alright, so let me break it down. I have five dice, and I want exactly one of them to show a 6. That means four of them should show something other than 6. Got it.

I remember that in probability, when dealing with specific outcomes, it's often useful to calculate the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, probability is favorable over total.

Total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Since each die has 6 faces, each die has 6 possibilities. So for five dice, it's 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me write that down: 6^5 = 7776. So that's the denominator for my probability.

Now, for the numerator, it's the number of favorable outcomes. Favorable outcomes here are the number of ways to get exactly one 6 in five dice. How do I compute that?

I think this is where combinations come into play. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter. So, the number of ways to choose which one die shows the 6. That's the combination of 5 dice taken 1 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number, and k is the number to choose.

So, C(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!)= (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)/(1 × 24) = 120 / 24 = 5. Okay, so there are 5 ways to choose which one die shows the 6.

Now, once I've chosen that one die, the other four must show something other than a 6. Each of those four dice has 5 possible outcomes (1-5). So, for each of those four dice, it's 5 possibilities each. So, the number of favorable outcomes for the four non-6 dice is 5^4.

Calculating 5^4: 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 625.

So, for each of the 5 choices of the die showing 6, there are 625 outcomes. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 × 625.

Let me compute that: 5 × 625 is 3125.

So, putting it all together, the probability is 3125 / 7776.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the steps.

First, total outcomes: 6^5 is indeed 7776. That seems right.

Number of ways to choose the one die showing 6: 5. Yep, that's correct.

Number of ways for the other four dice: Each has 5 possibilities, so 5^4 is 625. 5 × 625 is 3125. That all adds up.

Hmm, 3125/7776. Can this fraction be simplified?

Let me see: Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3125 and 7776.

Breaking it down:

3125 is 5^5, since 5^5 is 3125.

7776 is 6^5, which is (2×3)^5 = 2^5×3^5.

So, the factors of 3125 are powers of 5, and the factors of 7776 are powers of 2 and 3. There are no common factors besides 1. Therefore, the fraction 3125/7776 is already in its simplest form.

So, the probability is 3125/7776.

Just to get an idea, let me compute that as a decimal. 3125 ÷ 7776. Let me do that division.

3125 ÷ 7776 ≈ 0.4019. So roughly 40.19%.

That seems reasonable since with five dice, getting exactly one 6 is not too uncommon, and considering the number of combinations, it's plausible.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not overcomplicating this. Is there another way to think about it?

Alternatively, I remember that for each die, the probability of getting a 6 is 1/6, and not getting a 6 is 5/6. Since we're

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, I remember that each die roll is an independent event. That means the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others. So, each die has six possible outcomes, right? 1 through 6. 

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. So, out of the five dice, one should show a 6, and the other four should show something else—specifically, numbers that aren't 6. I think this is a case for the binomial probability formula because each die has two possible outcomes: success (rolling a 6) or failure (rolling something else). 

Let me recall the binomial probability formula. It's given by:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In this problem, each die has a 1/6 chance of rolling a 6, so p = 1/6. The probability of not rolling a 6 is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. We're rolling five dice, so n = 5, and we want exactly one success, so k = 1.

Let me plug these values into the formula:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

First, I need to calculate C(5, 1). That's the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 to be the one that shows a 6. I know that C(n, k) is calculated as n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, plugging in the numbers:

C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 120 / 24 = 5.

Okay, so there are 5 ways to get exactly one 6 in five dice. 

Next, I need to compute (1/6)^1, which is just 1/6. 

Then, (5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4. Let me calculate that. 

(5/6)^4 = (5^4) / (6^4) = 625 / 1296.

Now, putting it all together:

P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625 / 1296)

Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 5 and (1/6):

5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

Then, multiply that result by (625 / 1296):

(5/6) * (625 / 1296) = (5 * 625) / (6 * 1296) = 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, is that the simplest form? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 

3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. Since 5 and 6 are coprime, there are no common factors between numerator and denominator. So, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the probability is 3125 / 7776. If I want to express this as a decimal, I can divide 3125 by 7776. Let me do that.

3125 ÷ 7776 ≈ 0.4019, or about 40.19%.

Wait, let me verify that calculation. Sometimes when I do division in my head, I might make a mistake. So, 7776 goes into 3125 zero times. Let me compute 3125 ÷ 7776:

3125 ÷ 7776 ≈ 0.4019. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can cross-check by calculating 5 * (1/6) * (625 / 1296):

First, 1/6 is approximately 0.166666...

Then, 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253...

Multiplying these together: 0.166666... * 0
