<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple independent events, each die roll is an independent event. So, each die has an equal chance of landing on any number from 1 to 6, right? That means the probability of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 6 is 5/6. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the problem is about rolling five dice and getting exactly one 6. So, I think this is a binomial probability problem because each die roll is a trial with two possible outcomes: success (rolling a 6) or failure (rolling something else). The binomial probability formula is useful here, which is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * (p)^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- n is the number of trials.

In this case:
- n = 5 (since we're rolling five dice),
- k = 1 (we want exactly one 6),
- p = 1/6 (probability of rolling a 6 on one die).

So, plugging in those values, the formula becomes:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

I should calculate each part step by step. First, let's figure out C(5, 1). The combination C(n, k) is calculated as:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)! )

Where "!" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

So, for C(5, 1):
C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = 5! / (1! * 4!) 

I know that 5! is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120, and 4! is 4*3*2*1 = 24, and 1! is just 1.

So, substituting these values in:
C(5, 1) = 120 / (1 * 24) = 120 / 24 = 5.

Okay, so C(5, 1) is 5. That seems right because when you roll five dice, there are five different ways you could get exactly one 6. For example, the first die could be a 6, and the others not; the second die, and so on, up to the fifth die. So, five different scenarios.

Next, I need to calculate (1/6)^1. That's just 1/6, which is approximately 0.1667.

Then, (5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4. Let me compute that. I can do this step by step.

First, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. So, (5/6)^4 is 0.8333 raised to the power of 4.

I can compute 0.8333 * 0.8333 first, which is approximately 0.6944. Then, multiplying that by another 0.8333: 0.6944 * 0.8333 ≈ 0.5787. Multiplying that by another 0.8333: 0.5787 * 0.8333 ≈ 0.4823. So, approximately 0.4823.

Alternatively, I can calculate it more precisely:

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296. Let's divide 625 by 1296.

Dividing 625 by 1296:

1296 goes into 625 zero times. Add a decimal point, make it 6250.

1296 goes into 6250 about 4 times (1296*4=5184). Subtract 5184 from 6250: 6250-5184=1066.

Bring down a zero: 10660.

1296 goes into 10660 about 8 times (1296*8=10368). Subtract: 10660-10368=292.

Bring down a zero: 2920.

1296 goes into 2920 about 2 times (1296*2=2592). Subtract: 2920-

Alright, so I have this probability problem here: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step. I'm just starting to learn about probability, so I might have to figure out some concepts as I go.

First off, when we're talking about rolling dice, each die has six possible outcomes, right? So, for each die, the numbers 1 through 6 are equally likely. Now, we're rolling five dice, and we want the probability of getting exactly one 6. That means out of the five dice, one should show a 6, and the other four should show numbers other than 6.

Hmm, okay. So, this seems like a problem where I can use combinations and probabilities multiplied together. I remember something about binomial probability from my class, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall. Binomial probability is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. In this case, rolling a die can be considered a trial. A "success" would be rolling a 6, and a "failure" would be rolling anything else.

So, yeah, that sounds right. The binomial probability formula is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- (1-p) is the probability of failure.

Alright, so in this problem, n is 5 because we're rolling five dice. We want exactly one 6, so k is 1. The probability of success on a single trial, p, is 1/6 because there's one 6 out of six numbers. Therefore, the probability of failure, (1-p), is 5/6.

So, plugging these into the formula, we get:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, C(5, 1). I think that's the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 to be the 6. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, plugging in the numbers:

C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 5 / 1 = 5.

Okay, so there are 5 ways to get exactly one 6 in five dice.

Next, (1/6)^1 is just 1/6.

Then, (5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4. Let me compute that. 5/6 to the power of 4. Let me calculate that:

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296.

Wait, is that right? Let me check:

5^4 is 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. Okay, that's correct.

6^4 is 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296. Yep, so (5/6)^4 is 625/1296.

So, putting it all together:

P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296).

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm multiplying them correctly. So, 5 times (1/6) is 5/6. Then, 5/6 times 625/1296.

Alternatively, since all these are fractions, I can multiply them together step by step.

Let me write it out:

5 * (1/6) * (625/1296) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296).

First, 5 times (1/6) is 5/6.

Then, 5/6 times 625/1296.

Multiplying numerators: 5 * 625 = 3125.

Multiplying denominators: 6 * 1296 = 7776.

So, P(1) = 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, is that the final answer? Let me think.

Alternatively, I can also compute this using decimals to verify.
