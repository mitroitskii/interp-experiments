<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Since each die has 6 possible outcomes, the total number of combinations is \(6^5 = 7776\).

Next, I should calculate the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6. There are 5 dice, so there are 5 ways to choose which one will show the 6.

For the chosen die that shows a 6, it has only 1 possible outcome. The remaining 4 dice must show numbers other than 6, each of which has 5 possible outcomes.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is \(5 \times 1 \times 5^4 = 5 \times 625 = 3125\).

Finally, the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is \(\frac{3125}{7776}\).

To determine the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Number of Possible Outcomes**

   Each die has 6 possible outcomes. When rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:
   \[
   6^5 = 7776
   \]

2. **Number of Favorable Outcomes**

   We need exactly one die to show a 6 and the remaining four dice to show numbers other than 6.

   - **Choose which die shows the 6**: There are 5 possible choices.
   - **Outcomes for the chosen die**: Only 1 outcome (it must be a 6).
   - **Outcomes for the remaining four dice**: Each die has 5 possible outcomes (since they can't be 6).

   So, the number of favorable outcomes is:
   \[
   5 \times 1 \times 5^4 = 5 \times 625 = 3125
   \]

3. **Calculate the Probability**

   The probability \( P \) is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:
   \[
   P = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Possible Outcomes}} = \frac{3125}{7776}
   \]

4. **Simplify the Fraction (if needed)**

   The fraction \(\frac{3125}{7776}\) can be simplified. Since 3125 is \(5^5\) and 7776 is \(6^5\), there is no common factor other than 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{3125}{7776}}
\]

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that probability questions like this often involve combinations and maybe some binomial coefficients. Let me try to recall the steps.

First, when rolling dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes, right? So for five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5. Let me calculate that. 6*6*6*6*6... That's 6 multiplied by itself five times. So 6*6 is 36, 36*6 is 216, 216*6 is 1296, and 1296*6 is 7776. So, total possible outcomes are 7776.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. So, I need to figure out how many ways this can happen. That means one of the five dice shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. The numbers other than 6 on a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, so that's five possibilities.

I think this is a combination problem because the order in which the 6 appears doesn't matter. So, I need to choose which one of the five dice shows the 6. The number of ways to choose one die out of five is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.

So, in this case, n is 5 and k is 1. Plugging that into the formula: C(5,1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1*4*3*2*1) = 5 / 1 = 5. So, there are 5 ways to get exactly one 6.

But wait, that's just the number of favorable outcomes. Each of these outcomes has a certain probability. Each die has a 1/6 chance of showing a 6, and a 5/6 chance of showing something else. Since the dice are independent, the probability of getting exactly one 6 is the number of favorable outcomes multiplied by the probability of each specific outcome.

So, the probability should be 5 (the number of favorable outcomes) multiplied by (1/6) (for the one 6) and multiplied by (5/6)^4 (for the four non-6 outcomes). Let me write that down:

Probability = C(5,1) * (1/6) * (5/6)^4

Plugging in the numbers, that's 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4. Let me compute that step by step.

First, (5/6)^4. Let me calculate that. 5 divided by 6 is approximately 0.8333. Raising that to the fourth power:

0.8333^4. Let me compute this:

First, 0.8333 squared is approximately 0.6944. Then, squaring that gives 0.6944^2, which is approximately 0.4823. So, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

Then, 5 * (1/6) is approximately 5 * 0.1667 ≈ 0.8333.

Now, multiplying these two results together: 0.8333 * 0.4823 ≈ 0.4019.

So, the probability is approximately 0.4019, which is about 40.19%.

Wait, let me verify this calculation because it's important to be precise. Maybe I should calculate (5/6)^4 exactly.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296.

So, 625 divided by 1296. Let me compute that as a decimal.

625 ÷ 1296. Well, 1296 ÷ 2 is 648, so 625 is less than 648. So, 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.48225.

Then, 5 * (1/6) is 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

Now, 0.833333 * 0.48225 ≈ Let me compute this more accurately.

0.8 * 0.48225 = 0.3858

0.033333 * 0.48225 ≈ 0.016075

Adding them together: 0.3858 + 0.016075 ≈ 0.401875.

So, approximately 0
