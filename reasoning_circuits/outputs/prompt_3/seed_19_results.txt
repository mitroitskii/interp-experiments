<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that when dealing with multiple dice, each roll is independent. So, each die has 6 sides, numbers 1 through 6, each equally likely. When you roll five dice, each die is rolled independently, so the outcome of one doesn't affect the others.

I think this is a case where I can use combinations and probabilities multiplied together. Let me recall the formula for probability: probability = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes).

So, I need to figure out two things: the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice, and the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one of those dice shows a 6.

Starting with the total number of possible outcomes. Since each die has 6 possible outcomes, and we're rolling five dice, the total number of outcomes should be 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6*6*6*6*6. Hmm, 6*6 is 36, 36*6 is 216, 216*6 is 1296, and 1296*6 is 7776. Wait, let me verify that step by step: 6^1 is 6, 6^2 is 36, 6^3 is 216, 6^4 is 1296, and 6^5 is 7776. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 7776.

Now, onto the number of favorable outcomes. This is the number of ways we can get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. So, I need to choose which one of the five dice will show the 6, and then make sure the other four dice show something other than a 6.

How do I calculate that? I think it's a combination problem. There are 5 dice, and I want to choose 1 die to show a 6. The number of ways to choose which die is C(5,1), which is 5.

For each of these choices, the chosen die must show a 6, which has only 1 possibility, and the other four dice must show something that's not a 6. Each of those four dice has 5 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

So, for each of the 5 choices, the number of favorable outcomes for that specific die showing a 6 is 1 (for the 6) multiplied by 5^4 (for the other four dice). Let me calculate 5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, 5^4 is 625. Therefore, for each die chosen to be the 6, there are 625 favorable outcomes.

Since there are 5 different dice that could be the one showing the 6, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625. Let me compute that: 5 * 625 is 3125.

Wait, so if there are 3125 favorable outcomes, then the probability is 3125 divided by 7776.

But let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the calculation. Let's go back.

Total number of dice: 5. Each die: 6 sides. So, total outcomes: 6^5 = 7776. That seems right.

Number of ways to have exactly one 6: First, choose which die shows the 6. There are 5 dice, so C(5,1) = 5. For each such choice, the die shows a 6 (probability 1/6). Then, the other four dice must show something that's not a 6, so each of those dice has 5 possible outcomes, as I thought. So, 5^4 is 625. Hence, number of favorable outcomes: 5 * 1 * 625 = 3125.

Hence, probability is 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, I can simplify this fraction, perhaps? Let's see if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors.

3125 is 5^5, right? 5^5 is 3125. 7776, let's see: 7776 divided by 6 is 1296, divided by 6 again is 216, again is 36, again is 6. So 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. So, 7776 is 2

<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some basic probability concepts. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, I need to find how many ways I can get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

First, let me think about the total number of possible outcomes. Since each die has 6 faces, and we're rolling five dice, the total number of outcomes should be 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that. 6*6 is 36, 36*6 is 216, 216*6 is 1296, and 1296*6 is 7776. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Okay, now onto the favorable outcomes. I need exactly one 6. So, one of the five dice shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. Let me break this down. First, how many ways can the single 6 be rolled? Well, since there are five dice, the 6 can be on the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth die. That gives us 5 possible positions for the 6.

Now, for the other four dice, they shouldn't show a 6. Each of these dice has 5 possible outcomes (since 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are the non-6 numbers). So, for each of the four dice, there are 5 choices. That means the number of ways the other four dice can show non-6 numbers is 5^4.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, for each of the non-6 dice, we have 5 choices, and since the dice are independent, we multiply the number of choices for each die together. So, 5*5*5*5, which is 5^4. Let me compute that: 5*5 is 25, 25*5 is 125, 125*5 is 625. So, 625 ways for the four non-6 dice.

Now, since the position of the 6 can be any of the five dice, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose the position by the number of ways the other dice can show non-6 numbers. So, that's 5 (positions) multiplied by 625 (non-6 outcomes). Let me do that: 5*625. 5*600 is 3000, and 5*25 is 125, so 3000+125 is 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 3125 divided by 7776. Let me write that as a fraction: 3125/7776.

Wait, is this fraction reducible? Let me check. 3125 is 5^5, because 5*5*5*5*5 is 3125. 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5, so that's 2^5*3^5. Since 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5*3^5, they don't share any common factors besides 1. So, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Alternatively, if I wanted to express this as a decimal or a percentage, I could divide 3125 by 7776. Let me approximate that. 3125 divided by 7776. Let me see, 7776 divided by 3125 is roughly 2.48, so 1 divided by 2.48 is approximately 0.403. So, the probability is roughly 40.3%.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me verify the number of favorable outcomes. So, choosing one die to show a 6: 5 choices. The other four dice must show numbers other than 6, which are 1,2,3,4,5. So, each has 5 choices, so 5^4 is 625. Multiply by 5: 3125. That seems right.

Total number of possible outcomes: 6^5 is 7776. So, 3125/7776 is approximately 0.403, or 40.3%. Hmm, that seems plausible.

Wait, another way to think about this is using combinations. The number of ways to choose which die shows
