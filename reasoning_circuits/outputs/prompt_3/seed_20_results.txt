<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice, I can break down the problem using combinations and probabilities of independent events.

First, I determine how many ways there are to choose which one of the five dice shows a 6. This is calculated by the combination formula, which gives me 5 possible combinations.

Next, I consider the outcome of each chosen die showing a 6. The probability of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1/6.

Then, for the remaining four dice, each has to show a number other than 6. The probability of not rolling a 6 on a single die is 5/6. Since the outcomes are independent, I multiply the probabilities for all four dice, resulting in (5/6)^4.

Finally, I multiply the number of combinations by the probability of each specific outcome to get the total probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice.

To determine the probability of rolling exactly one **6** when rolling five dice, we can use the concept of combinations and probabilities of independent events. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Possible Outcomes:**
   
   - Each die has 6 possible outcomes.
   - With 5 dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:
     
     \[
     6^5 = 7776
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Favorable Outcomes:**
   
   - We need exactly **1** die to show a **6**, and the remaining **4** dice to show numbers other than **6**.

3. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Choose Which Die Shows the 6:**
   
   - This is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose **1** die out of **5** is:
     
     \[
     \binom{5}{1} = 5
     \]

4. **Calculate the Probability for Each Favorable Outcome:**
   
   - The probability of rolling a **6** on one die is:
     
     \[
     \frac{1}{6}
     \]
   
   - The probability of not rolling a **6** on one die is:
     
     \[
     \frac{5}{6}
     \]
   
   - For the remaining **4** dice, the combined probability is:
     
     \[
     \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4
     \]

5. **Multiply the Number of Favorable Outcomes by the Probability for Each:**
   
   - Total probability:
     
     \[
     \binom{5}{1} \times \frac{1}{6} \times \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = 5 \times \frac{1}{6} \times \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4
     \]

6. **Calculate the Final Probability:**
   
   - Compute the values:
     
     \[
     5 \times \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{625}{1296} = \frac{3125}{7776}
     \]

   - Simplify the fraction:
     
     \[
     \frac{3125}{7776} \approx 0.4019
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{\frac{3125}{7776}}
   \]

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it's often helpful to use combinations and probabilities of independent events. Each die roll is independent, so the outcome of one doesn't affect the others. Since we're dealing with five dice, each has an equal chance of landing on numbers 1 through 6.

The question is about getting exactly one 6. That means out of the five dice, one die shows a 6, and the other four show numbers other than 6. I need to figure out the number of favorable outcomes and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes.

Let me start by calculating the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Each die has 6 possible outcomes, and since the dice are independent, we multiply the number of outcomes for each die together. So that's 6^5. Let me compute that: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, there are 7776 total possible outcomes.

Now, for the favorable outcomes: exactly one 6. To find this, I can use combinations to determine how many ways one 6 can appear in five dice, and then the other four dice must show numbers that are not 6.

First, I need to choose which one of the five dice shows the 6. The number of ways to choose this is given by the combination formula C(n, k), which is n! / (k!(n - k)!). So here, n is 5 (since there are five dice) and k is 1 (since we want exactly one 6). Calculating that: 5! / (1! * (5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(1*4*3*2*1) = 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which die will show the 6.

Next, for the remaining four dice, each must show a number that is not 6. Since each die can show numbers 1 through 5 (excluding 6), each of these four dice has 5 possible outcomes. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for these four dice is 5^4. Let me compute that: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, 625 ways.

Now, to find the total number of favorable outcomes, I multiply the number of ways to choose the die showing 6 by the number of favorable outcomes for the other four dice. That is 5 * 625. Let me calculate that: 5*600=3000 and 5*25=125, so 3000 + 125 = 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That is 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, can this fraction be simplified? Let me check. I know that both numerator and denominator are divisible by 25. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 25: 3125 ÷ 25 = 125, and 7776 ÷ 25 = 311.04. Wait, that's not a whole number. Hmm, maybe I should try a different divisor. Let's see if both are divisible by 5: 3125 ÷ 5 = 625, and 7776 ÷ 5 = 1555.2. Again, not a whole number. How about 3? 3125 ÷ 3 ≈ 1041.666, which isn't a whole number. Maybe 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5. Let me check:

6^5 = 6*6*6*6*6 = 7776, which we already know. 3125 is 5^5, which is 3125. So, 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5. So, 3125/7776 is (5/6)^5, but wait, no, that would be if we were talking about all dice showing 5 or 6, but in this case, it's a bit different.

Wait, actually, 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5, so 3125/7776 is (5/6)^5. Hmm, is that right? Let me verify: (5/6)^5 = 3125/777
