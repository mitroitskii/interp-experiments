Okay, so I have this probability problem here: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with probability, it often helps to break the problem down into smaller parts. So, in this case, I'm dealing with five dice, each of which has six sides, numbered from 1 to 6. I need to find the probability of getting exactly one 6 and the other four dice showing numbers other than 6.

Hmm, okay. So maybe I can think about this in terms of combinations and permutations. Let me recall: when we have independent events like dice rolls, the probability of multiple events is the product of their individual probabilities. But since each die is independent, the outcome of one doesn't affect the others.

Now, for exactly one 6 in five dice, I believe this is a case where we can use the binomial probability formula. Wait, is that right? Let me think. So, in a binomial distribution, we have a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes (usually referred to as success or failure), and we're looking for the probability of a certain number of successes.

In this problem, each die roll is a trial. A "success" would be rolling a 6, and a "failure" would be rolling anything else. So, we have five trials, we want exactly one success (rolling a 6 once), and the rest are failures (rolling 1-5). Yeah, that sounds right. So, the binomial probability formula should work here.

Alright, the binomial probability formula is: P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- n is the total number of trials.

In our case:
- n = 5 dice,
- k = 1 success (rolling a 6),
- p = probability of rolling a 6 on a single die.

So, first, let me compute p. Since a die has six sides, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6. Got that.

Then, p = 1/6, which is approximately 0.1667.

Now, let's compute C(n, k). That's the combination of 5 dice taken 1 at a time. C(5,1) is calculated as 5! / (1! * (5-1)!), which simplifies to 5 / (1*4) = 5/4? Wait, no. Wait, 5! is 120, and 1! is 1, and (5-1)! is 24, so 120 / (1 * 24) is 5. Yeah, that's correct. So, C(5,1) is 5.

Alright, so plugging into the formula, P(1) = C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1). Let me break that down:

C(5,1) is 5.

(1/6)^1 is just 1/6.

(5/6)^(4) is... let me compute that. (5/6)^4. So 5^4 is 625, and 6^4 is 1296. So, that's 625 / 1296.

So, putting it all together, P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625 / 1296). Let me compute that.

First, 5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

Then, 5/6 multiplied by 625/1296.

Multiplying numerators: 5 * 625 = 3125

Multiplying denominators: 6 * 1296 = 7776

So, 3125 / 7776.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776.

Hmm, let me check to make sure I did that correctly.

Wait, so 5 dice, exactly one 6, each die is independent.

Another way to think about it is: How many possible outcomes are there when rolling five dice? Each die has 6 sides, so for five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5, which is 7776. That's the denominator for our probability.

Now, for the numerator, how many favorable outcomes are there? We need exactly one die showing a 6, and the other four showing something else.

First, choose which one of the five dice shows the

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let's see. I think I need to figure out how many ways I can get exactly one 6 out of five dice, and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. That should give me the probability. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's recall that when rolling a die, there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Each outcome is equally likely, right? So, the probability of getting any specific number on a single die roll is 1/6. Conversely, the probability of not getting that specific number is 5/6.

Now, the problem is about rolling five dice and getting exactly one 6. So, I need to consider each die as an independent event because the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others. That makes sense.

To find the probability of getting exactly one 6, I think I should use combinations because the order in which the 6 appears doesn't matter. It's about how many different ways one 6 can occur among the five dice. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of trials, and k is the number of successful trials. In this case, n is 5 dice, and k is 1 six.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(5, 1). Let me compute that: 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (1 × 24) ) Wait, actually, 5! is 120, and 4! is 24, so 120 / (1 × 24) is 5. So, there are 5 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Next, I need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Since each die has 6 possible outcomes, and the dice are independent, the total number of outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 6^5.

Let me compute 6^5. 6 × 6 is 36, 36 × 6 is 216, 216 × 6 is 1296, 1296 × 6 is 7776. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Now, the probability of getting exactly one 6 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 5 / 7776.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. So, the number of ways to get exactly one 6 is 5 choose 1, which is 5. Each of these favorable outcomes has a probability of (1/6) for the single 6 and (5/6) for the other four dice showing something that's not a 6.

So, another way to compute the probability is: for each die, the probability that it's the one showing a 6 is (1/6), and the probability that the other four dice show something other than 6 is (5/6) each. Since the dice are independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each die.

Therefore, the probability should be 5 × (1/6) × (5/6)^4. Let me compute that to see if it matches the previous result.

First, (5/6)^4 is equal to (625/1296). Then, multiplying by (1/6) gives 625 / 7776. Then, multiplying by 5 gives 3125 / 7776. Hmm, that's the same as 5 / 7776 multiplied by 625, which is 3125 / 7776. Wait, but 5 / 7776 is approximately 0.000643, and 3125 / 7776 is approximately 0.403. Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, hold on, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recast it. 5 × (1/6) × (5/6)^4 is 5 × (1/6) × (625/1296). Let's compute that step by step.

First, 1/6 × 625/1296. Let's compute 625 divided by 1296. Well, 625 ÷ 1296 is approximately 0.48225. Then, 0.48225 × (1/6) is approximately 0.080375. Then, multiplying by 5 gives approximately
