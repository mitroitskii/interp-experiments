Alright, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving dice, it's often useful to consider combinations and the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has 6 sides, so when rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes should be 6 raised to the power of 5. Let me calculate that real quick: 6*6*6*6*6 is 7776. Yeah, that's right. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Now, I need to find how many of these outcomes result in exactly one 6. Hmm, how do I approach that? I think I can use combinations here. So, the idea is that I want exactly one die to show a 6 and the remaining four dice to show something else, specifically numbers that are not 6.

Alright, so let's break it down. First, I need to choose which one of the five dice is going to be the 6. Since the dice are identical in terms of probability, the order doesn't matter, so I can use combinations to figure out how many ways this can happen. The number of ways to choose one die out of five is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, plugging in n=5 and k=1, that's 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(1*(4*3*2*1)) = 5. So, there are 5 different ways to have exactly one 6 in the five dice.

Next, I need to figure out how many ways the other four dice can show numbers that are not 6. Each of these four dice has to show a number from 1 to 5, since we're excluding 6. So, each die has 5 possible outcomes. Since the dice are independent, I can multiply the number of outcomes for each die to get the total number of outcomes for these four dice.

So, for each of these four dice, there are 5 choices, and since there are four dice, the total number of favorable outcomes for these four dice is 5^4. Let me calculate that: 5*5*5*5 is 625. So, there are 625 possible outcomes for the four non-6 dice.

Now, to find the total number of favorable outcomes (i.e., outcomes where exactly one die is a 6 and the rest are not), I need to multiply the number of ways to choose which die is the 6 by the number of outcomes for the other four dice. That would be 5 (from the combinations) multiplied by 625. Let me calculate that: 5*625 is 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Putting it all together, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that would be 3125 divided by 7776. Let me simplify that fraction if possible. Let me see if both numbers are divisible by something. Let's try 25: 3125 ÷25 is 125, and 7776 ÷25 is... wait, 7776 ÷25 is 311.04, which isn't an integer. Hmm, maybe 3? 3125 ÷3 is approximately 1041.666, which isn't an integer either. How about 5? 3125 ÷5 is 625, and 7776 ÷5 is 1555.2, still not an integer. Maybe 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5. Let me check: 5^5 is indeed 3125, and 6^5 is 7776. So, the fraction 3125/7776 can be written as (5^5)/(6^5). I don't think it simplifies further because 5 and 6 are coprime. So, the probability is 3125/7776.

Wait, let me just double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, choosing one die out of five to be a 6 gives 5 possibilities. Each of the remaining four dice has 5 choices (since they can't be 6). So, 5*5^4=5^5=3125. The total number of outcomes is 6^5=7776. So, the probability is indeed 3125/7776. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can also think of this

Alright, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving dice, it's often useful to consider combinations and the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5, right? Let me calculate that. 6^5 is 6 multiplied by itself five times: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, there are 7,776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Now, the next part is figuring out how many of those outcomes result in exactly one 6. To do this, I think I need to use combinations because the order in which the dice show up might not matter. Wait, actually, when calculating the number of favorable outcomes, I do need to consider the specific dice that show the 6 because each die is distinct in terms of its position.

So, if I have five dice, I want exactly one of them to show a 6. That means I need to choose which one of the five dice will show the 6. The number of ways to choose one die out of five is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). In this case, n is 5 and k is 1. So, C(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(1*4*3*2*1) = 5. So, there are 5 possible ways to have exactly one 6.

But wait, that's just the selection of which die shows the 6. Each of those dice can show a 6, and the remaining dice must show something other than 6. Since each die has 5 other possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the number of ways the remaining four dice can show non-6 numbers is 5^4.

Let me calculate 5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, for each of the 5 choices of which die shows the 6, there are 625 ways the other four dice can show non-6 numbers. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625 = 3125.

So, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That is, 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, can this fraction be simplified? Let me check. Both 3125 and 7776 are divisible by... well, 3125 is 5^5, since 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. And 7776, let me see, 7776 divided by 3125... Wait, 7776 is actually 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. 3125 is 5^5, so they don't have any common factors besides 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

So, the probability is 3125/7776. To express this as a decimal, I can divide 3125 by 7776. Let me do that: 3125 ÷ 7776 ≈ 0.4019, so approximately 40.19%.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. So, total outcomes: 6^5=7776, that's correct. Number of favorable: C(5,1)*(5^4)=5*625=3125. That seems right. So, 3125/7776 is approximately 0.4019, or about 40.19%. Hmm, that seems reasonable.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the probability of getting exactly one 6 is equal to the number of ways to have one 6 and four non-6s, multiplied by the probability of each such outcome. Since each outcome is equally likely, that's the same as the number of favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the binomial probability formula. In this case, it's similar to flipping five coins and getting exactly one head. The formula is C(n, k)*(p)^k*(1-p)^(n - k). Here, n=5, k=1, p=1/6.
