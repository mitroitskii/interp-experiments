Alright, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, okay, let me try to think this through step by step. I remember that probability often involves figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out two things: how many total possible outcomes are there when rolling five dice, and how many of those outcomes result in exactly one 6.

First, for the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Since each die has 6 sides, and each die roll is independent, I think the total number of possible outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself five times. So, 6^5. Let me write that down: 6^5. Calculating that, 6*6 is 36, times 6 is 216, times 6 is 1296, times 6 is 7776. Okay, so there are 7,776 total possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Now, I need to figure out how many of these outcomes result in exactly one 6. Hmm, so I need exactly one of the five dice to show a 6, and the other four dice should not show a 6. Let me think about how to calculate that.

I remember that in probability, when dealing with successes and failures, we can use combinations. Since we want exactly one success (a die showing a 6) out of five trials (dice), the number of ways this can happen is given by the combination formula. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we want to choose. In this case, n is 5 and k is 1. So, C(5,1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!).

Let me compute that: 5! is 120, and 1! is 1, and (5 - 1)! is 4!, which is 24. So, 120 / (1 * 24) = 5. So, there are 5 ways to choose which single die shows the 6.

Now, for each of those 5 choices, how many favorable outcomes are there for the rest of the dice? Well, the other four dice should not show a 6. Since each die has 5 other possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), each of those four dice has 5 choices. So, the number of possible outcomes for the other four dice is 5^4.

Calculating 5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So, there are 625 possible outcomes for the four dice that don't show a 6.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose which die shows the 6 multiplied by the number of outcomes for the remaining dice. That is 5 * 625. Let me calculate that: 5 * 625. Well, 5*600=3000 and 5*25=125, so 3000 + 125 is 3125. So, there are 3,125 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that is 3,125 / 7,776.

Hmm, can I simplify that fraction? Let me check. 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5. Since 5 and 6 are coprime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1, I don't think the fraction can be simplified further. So, the probability is 3125/7776.

Let me double-check my reasoning. So, when dealing with exactly k successes in n trials, the number of favorable outcomes is C(n, k) * (success probability)^k * (failure probability)^(n - k). Wait, is that true? Or is it C(n, k) * (number of failures)^{n - k}?

Wait, in this case, each die is an independent trial with probability 1/6 of success (rolling a 6) and probability 5/6 of failure (not rolling a 6). So, actually, the probability is C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4. Calculating that: 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296).

Wait, let me see: (1/6) is 1/6, and (5/6)^4 is 625/1296, so 1/6 *

Okay, so I have this probability problem: What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about combinations and maybe the binomial probability formula. Let me break it down.

First, when we're dealing with dice, each die has six possible outcomes, right? So, when rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6 * 6 is 36, 36 * 6 is 216, 216 * 6 is 1296, and 1296 * 6 is 7776. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 7776. That seems right.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability of getting exactly one 6. So, we need to figure out how many ways this can happen. I think this is a combinatorial problem where we need to choose which one of the five dice shows a 6 and the other four show numbers other than 6. 

Let me recall the concept of combinations here. The number of ways to choose exactly one die out of five to be a 6 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, in this case, n is 5 and k is 1. Let me compute that: 5! is 120, and 1! is 1, so it's 120 / (1 * 24) which is 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 ways to get exactly one 6.

But wait, that's not the end of the story. Because each die that isn't showing a 6 can show any number from 1 to 5. So, for each of the other four dice, there are 5 possible outcomes instead of 6. Therefore, for each of these combinations, the number of favorable outcomes is 5^4.

Let me compute 5^4: 5 * 5 is 25, 25 * 5 is 125, and 125 * 5 is 625. So, each of the 5 combinations has 625 favorable outcomes. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625.

Calculating that: 5 * 625 is 3125. So, there are 3125 favorable outcomes where exactly one die shows a 6.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, I wonder if that fraction can be simplified. Let me check. 3125 and 7776. Hmm, 3125 is 5^5, right? Because 5 * 5 is 25, 25 * 5 is 125, 125 * 5 is 625, 625 * 5 is 3125. So, 3125 is 5^5. What about 7776? Let me factor that. 7776 divided by 6 is 1296, divided by 6 is 216, divided by 6 is 36, divided by 6 is 6, and divided by 6 is 1. So, 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. So, 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5. 

So, 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5. They don't have any common factors besides 1, so the fraction can't be simplified further. Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776.

Alternatively, I can express this as a decimal or a percentage if needed, but the question just asks for the probability, so I think the fraction is acceptable. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. So, I considered that for exactly one 6, we choose which die it is (5 choices), and then the other four dice have to show numbers from 1 to 5, which gives 5^4 possibilities. So, that's 5 * 5^4 = 5^5 = 3125. Total possibilities are 6^5 = 7776. That seems correct.

Let me double-check the combination part. When we're dealing with exactly one success (in this case, rolling a 6), the formula is indeed C(n, 1) * (p/(1 - q))^1, but in
