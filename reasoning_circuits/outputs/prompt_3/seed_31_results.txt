<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem here: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, especially fair dice, each roll is independent. That means the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others. So, rolling a 6 on one die doesn't make it more or less likely for the others. Got that.

The problem is about getting exactly one 6 out of five dice. Hmm, so I think this is a binomial probability problem because each die has two possible outcomes (success or failure, where success is rolling a 6 and failure is rolling anything else). Let me recall the formula for binomial probability.

The probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.
- p is the probability of success on a single trial.
- (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In this case, n is 5 because we have five dice. k is 1 because we want exactly one 6. The probability p of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1/6, right? Because there are six possible outcomes (1-6) and only one of them is a 6. So, p = 1/6.

Then, the probability of not rolling a 6 on a single die, which is (1-p), would be 5/6. That makes sense because there are five other outcomes that aren't 6.

So, plugging these into the formula, we get:

P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, C(5,1). I remember that combinations are calculated as:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

Where "!" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

So, for C(5,1):

C(5,1) = 5! / (1! * (5-1)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (1 * 4*3*2*1) = 120 / (1 * 24) = 5

Wait, 5! is 120, and 4! is 24. So yes, 120 divided by 24 is 5. So, C(5,1) = 5.

Okay, so that part is straightforward.

Next, (1/6)^1. That's just 1/6.

Then, (5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4. Hmm, okay, let's compute that. I think it's easier if I just multiply it out.

(5/6)^4 = (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6).

Calculating step by step:
First, 5/6 * 5/6 = 25/36.
Then, 25/36 * 5/6. Let's see, 25 * 5 is 125, and 36 * 6 is 216. So that's 125/216.
Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 36 * 6 is 216? Let me check: 36*5 is 180, plus 6 is 186. Wait, no: hold on. 36 times 6: 30*6=180, 6*6=36, so 180+36=216. Hmm, actually, that is correct.

Wait, but earlier I said 25/36 * 5/6 is 125/216. Let me verify that: 25 times 5 is 125, and 36 times 6 is 216. Yeah, that's right. Hmm, seems okay.

Wait, no, sorry, no. Hold on. 25/36 multiplied by 5/6 is 125/(36*6) = 125/216. Hmm, okay, that seems correct.

So, (5/6)^4 is 125/216.

Putting it all together, P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (125/216)

Let me compute that.

First, multiply 5 and (1/6). That's 5/6.

Then, multiply 5/6 by 125/216.

Hmm, 5/6 *

Alright, so I have this probability problem here: "What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?" Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it often involves combinations and some basic probability rules. So, let's break it down.

When you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes, right? Each face from 1 to 6. So, when rolling five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, there are 7,776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Got that.

Now, the question is about getting exactly one 6. So, I need to figure out how many ways this can happen. Hmm. Since we're dealing with exactly one success (rolling a 6) and the rest being non-successes (rolling something else), this sounds like a binomial probability problem.

Wait, is it binomial? Let me recall: binomial probability is used when there are exactly two possible outcomes for each trial, like success or failure. In this case, rolling a die can be considered a trial where success is rolling a 6, and failure is rolling anything else (1-5). So yes, this is a binomial scenario.

So, the binomial probability formula is: P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In this case, n is 5 (since we're rolling five dice), k is 1 (we want exactly one 6), p is the probability of rolling a 6 on a single die, which is 1/6, and (1-p) is the probability of not rolling a 6, which is 5/6.

So, plugging into the formula: P(1) = C(5, 1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^(5-1).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, C(5, 1). That's the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 to be the 6. I know that C(n, k) is calculated as n! / (k! * (n - k)! ). So, plugging in the numbers: 5! / (1! * 4!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(1*(4*3*2*1)) = 120 / 24 = 5. So, C(5,1) is 5.

Next, (1/6)^1 is just 1/6.

Then, (5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4. Let me compute that. 5/6 to the power of 4. Hmm, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333, but since we're dealing with exact fractions, let's compute it as fractions.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296.

So, putting it all together: P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625 / 1296).

Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 5 and 1/6: 5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

Then, multiply that by 625/1296: (5/6) * (625/1296). Multiplying the numerators: 5 * 625 = 3125. Multiplying the denominators: 6 * 1296. Let me compute 6*1296: 1296*6. 1000*6=6000, 200*6=1200, 90*6=540, 6*6=36. So, 6000+1200=7200, 7200+540=7740, 7740+36=7776. So, 6*1296=7776.

Therefore, P(1) = 3125 / 7776.

Hmm, is that the simplest form? Let me check if 3125 and 7776 have any common factors. 3125 is 5^5, since 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. So
