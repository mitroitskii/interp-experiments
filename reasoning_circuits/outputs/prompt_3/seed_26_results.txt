Okay, so I need to find the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, probability problems can be tricky, but I think I can figure this out by breaking it down step by step.

First, let me remember the basics. When rolling dice, each die has 6 sides, numbered 1 through 6, and each number has an equal chance of appearing. So, for each die, the probability of getting a specific number is 1/6, right?

Now, since we're dealing with multiple dice, and we want exactly one specific outcome (rolling a 6), this seems like a binomial probability problem. Binomial because we're dealing with a fixed number of independent trials (in this case, rolling five dice), each with two possible outcomes (success, which is rolling a 6, or failure, which is not rolling a 6). Yeah, that sounds right.

The formula for binomial probability is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes.
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n - k)!).
- p is the probability of success on a single trial.
- (1-p) is the probability of failure.

In this problem:
- n = 5 (since we have five dice)
- k = 1 (we want exactly one 6)
- p = 1/6 (probability of rolling a 6)
- 1-p = 5/6 (probability of not rolling a 6)

Alright, so let's plug in these values into the formula.

First, let's compute C(5, 1). C(5,1) is the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5 to be the one that shows a 6. Since there are 5 dice, there are 5 different ways this can happen.

So, C(5,1) = 5. That seems straightforward.

Next, p^k is (1/6)^1, which is just 1/6. Easy enough.

Then, (1-p)^(n - k) is (5/6)^(5 - 1) = (5/6)^4. I need to compute that value. Let me do that.

First, (5/6)^1 is 5/6 ≈ 0.8333

(5/6)^2 = 5/6 * 5/6 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944

(5/6)^3 = 25/36 * 5/6 = 125/216 ≈ 0.5787

(5/6)^4 = 125/216 * 5/6 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.4823

Wait, but maybe I should keep it as a fraction to be exact for the calculation. So, (5/6)^4 is 625/1296. Right, so I'll use that fraction in the probability calculation to be precise.

Putting it all together, the probability P(1) is C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4.

So, that's 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 5 * (1/6) is 5/6.

Then, (5/6) * (625/1296). Multiply the numerators: 5 * 625 = 3125.

Multiply the denominators: 6 * 1296. Let me compute 6 * 1296.

6 * 1200 = 7200,

6 * 96 = 576,

So, 7200 + 576 = 7776.

So, the total probability is 3125 / 7776.

Now, let me see if this fraction can be simplified. The numerator is 3125 and the denominator is 7776.

Hmm, 3125 is 5^5, since 5^5 = 3125.

And 7776 is 6^5, because 6^5 = 7776.

Wait, is that correct? Let's verify:

6^1 = 6

6^2 = 36

6^3 = 216

6^4 = 1296

6^5 = 7776. Yes, that's correct.

So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 6^5. Therefore, the fraction is (5/6)^5, which is the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. So

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let's see. I remember that probability problems often involve combinations and calculating the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Let me break this down step by step.

First, when rolling five dice, each die has six possible outcomes, right? So, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice would be 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that. 6*6 is 36, 36*6 is 216, 216*6 is 1296, and 1296*6 is 7776. So, there are 7,776 possible outcomes in total.

Now, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the number of ways to get exactly one 6 and four non-6 numbers. Hmm, okay. So, I guess I need to figure out how many different ways this can happen.

I think this involves combinations because the order in which the 6s appear might not matter. Wait, actually, in this case, since each die is distinct, the order does matter, but when we're counting the number of favorable outcomes, we can think of it as choosing which one of the five dice shows a 6 and the rest show numbers other than 6.

So, first, how many ways can we choose which one die shows a 6? That should be 5 choose 1, which is 5. Yeah, that makes sense because there are five dice, and we want to choose one to be the 6.

Now, for the die that shows a 6, that's fixed. But for the other four dice, each of them has to show something that's not a 6. Since each die has numbers 1 through 6, the numbers that are not 6 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. So, each of those four dice has 5 possible outcomes.

Therefore, for each of the four non-6 dice, there are 5 choices. So, the number of ways for those four dice is 5 multiplied by itself four times, which is 5^4. Let me compute that. 5*5 is 25, 25*5 is 125, 125*5 is 625. So, 625 ways.

Wait, so putting it all together, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose which die is the 6 multiplied by the number of ways the other dice can show non-6 numbers. So, that's 5 * 625. Let me calculate that. 5*625 is 3125. So, there are 3,125 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 3125 divided by 7776.

Hmm, I should probably simplify that fraction. Let me see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by a common factor. Let's try dividing by 25 first. 3125 divided by 25 is 125, and 7776 divided by 25 is... wait, 7776 divided by 25 is 311.04, which is not an integer, so that's not a clean division. Maybe 3125 is 5^5, right? 5*5*5*5*5 is 3125. And 7776 is 6^5, which is 6*6*6*6*6.

Is there a common factor between 3125 and 7776? Let me see. 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 6^5, which is (2*3)^5, so that's 2^5 * 3^5. So, there are no common prime factors between the numerator and the denominator. That means the fraction is already in its simplest form.

So, the probability is 3125/7776. If I want to write that as a decimal, I can divide 3125 by 7776. Let me approximate that. 3125 divided by 7776 is approximately... let's see. 3125 divided by 7776. 7776 goes into 3125 zero times. Let's add a decimal point and some zeros. 7776 goes into 31250 four times because 4*7776 is 31,104. Subtract that from 31,250, which gives 146. Then bring down the next zero, making it 1460. 7776 goes into 1460 zero times. Next, bring down another zero, making it 14,600. 7776 goes into 14,600 once, because
