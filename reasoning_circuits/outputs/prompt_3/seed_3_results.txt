<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the probability of rolling exactly one six when rolling five dice. To do this, I'll use the binomial probability formula.

The binomial probability formula is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

In this case, n is 5 (since there are five dice), k is 1 (we want exactly one six), and p is 1/6 (the probability of rolling a six on a single die).

I'll start by calculating the combination C(5, 1), which represents the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 5.

C(5, 1) = 5

Next, I'll calculate p^k, which is (1/6)^1 = 1/6.

Then, I'll calculate (1-p)^(n-k), which is (5/6)^(5-1) = (5/6)^4.

Finally, I'll multiply all these values together to find the probability.

P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4

To find the probability of rolling exactly one 6 when rolling five dice, we can use the **binomial probability formula**. 

The binomial probability formula is:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the total number of trials (dice rolls) = 5
- \( k \) is the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 6) = 1
- \( p \) is the probability of success on a single trial (rolling a 6) = \( \frac{1}{6} \)
- \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the combination of \( n \) things taken \( k \) at a time

Let's plug in the values:

1. Calculate the combination \( \binom{5}{1} \):
   \[
   \binom{5}{1} = 5
   \]

2. Calculate \( p^k \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^1 = \frac{1}{6}
   \]

3. Calculate \( (1-p)^{n-k} \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{5-1} = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296}
   \]

4. Multiply all parts together:
   \[
   P(1) = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{625}{1296}
   \]
   \[
   P(1) = \frac{5 \cdot 1 \cdot 625}{6 \cdot 1296}
   \]
   \[
   P(1) = \frac{3125}{7776}
   \]

So, the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{3125}{7776}}
\]

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. 

First, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple dice, it's often helpful to use combinations and the binomial probability formula. Each die roll is an independent event, right? So, the probability of getting a 6 on a single die is 1/6, and the probability of not getting a 6 is 5/6.

Now, since I'm dealing with five dice, and I want exactly one of them to show a 6, I should figure out how many different ways this can happen. That's where combinations come into play. The number of ways to choose one die out of five to be the 6 is given by the combination formula, which is:

C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)

In this case, n is 5 (the number of dice) and k is 1 (the number of desired outcomes). Plugging in those numbers, we get:

C(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5 - 1)!) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (1 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 5 / 1 = 5

So, there are 5 different ways to get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice.

Next, I need to calculate the probability for each of these scenarios and then add them together. Since each scenario is equally likely, the probability will be the same for each case, so I can just multiply the probability of one specific scenario by the number of scenarios.

What's the probability of rolling exactly one 6? Well, for one specific die to show a 6 and the others to show something else, it's (1/6) for the 6 and (5/6) for each of the other four dice. So, the probability for one specific scenario is:

(1/6) × (5/6)^4

Let me compute that. First, (5/6)^4 is:

5^4 = 625
6^4 = 1296
So, (5/6)^4 = 625 / 1296

Then, multiplying by 1/6:

(1/6) × (625 / 1296) = 625 / 7776

But wait, that's just for one specific die. Since there are 5 dice, each of which could be the one showing the 6, I need to multiply this probability by 5. So:

Total probability = 5 × (625 / 7776) = 3125 / 7776

Let me check if that reduces or if it's already in its simplest form. 3125 and 7776, do they have any common factors?

3125 is 5^5, right? 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5. And 7776 is 6^5, which is (2 × 3)^5 = 2^5 × 3^5. So, 3125 is 5^5 and 7776 is 2^5 × 3^5. They don't share any common prime factors, so the fraction can't be simplified further.

Therefore, the probability is 3125/7776. If I want to express this as a decimal, I can divide 3125 by 7776. Let me see:

3125 ÷ 7776 ≈ 0.4019, so approximately 40.19%.

Wait, let me verify that calculation. Maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I should use another approach to double-check.

Another way to think about this is using the binomial probability formula, which is:

P(k) = C(n, k) × p^k × (1 - p)^(n - k)

Where:
- n = number of trials (dice rolls) = 5
- k = number of successful outcomes (rolling a 6) = 1
- p = probability of success on a single trial = 1/6
- (1 - p) = probability of failure = 5/6

Plugging in the numbers:

P(1) = C(5, 1) × (1/6)^1 × (5/6)^(5 - 1) = 5 × (1/6) × (5/6)^4

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, that confirms that the calculation is correct.

So, computing (5/6)^4:

5/6 is approximately 0.833333...
