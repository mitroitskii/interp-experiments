<｜User｜>What's the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me start by thinking about probability basics. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, right? So in this case, I should find how many ways there are to get exactly one 6 when rolling five dice, and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

First, let me calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Since each die has 6 faces, and we're rolling five dice, the total number of outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me write that down: 6^5.

Now, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the number of ways to get exactly one 6. So, we need one die showing a 6 and the other four dice showing numbers other than 6. 

How do I calculate that? Well, I think I need to use combinations here. Since we're looking for exactly one 6, we have to choose which one of the five dice will show the 6. So that's a combination of 5 dice taken 1 at a time.

Then, for the other four dice, each needs to show something that's not a 6. There are 5 possible numbers for each of these dice (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). So for each of these four dice, there are 5 possibilities.

Wait, let me clarify. For the chosen die that shows a 6, there's only one outcome. For the other four dice, each can show 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So each of those four dice has 5 choices. So the total number of favorable outcomes should be the number of ways to choose which die is the 6, multiplied by 5^4.

In mathematical terms, that would be C(5,1) * 5^4.

So putting that together, the total number of favorable outcomes is C(5,1) * 5^4.

Let me compute that. C(5,1) is 5, right? Because there are 5 ways to choose one die out of five. Then 5^4 is 5 multiplied by itself four times. Let me calculate 5^4: 5 * 5 is 25, 25 * 5 is 125, 125 * 5 is 625. Wait, no, that's 5^5 which is 3125. Wait, no, 5^4 is 5*5*5*5, so that's 25*25? No, wait, 25*5 is 125, and 125 is 5^3. Wait, hold on. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, 5^1 is 5, 5^2 is 25, 5^3 is 125, and 5^4 is 625. Yes, that's right. So 5^4 is 625. So the number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 625, which is 3125.

Wait, but hold on. If I have 5 choices for which die shows the 6, and for each of the remaining four dice, 5 choices each, that would be 5 * 5^4. So yeah, 5 * 625 is 3125. So that's the number of favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 3125 divided by 6^5.

Let me compute 6^5 to make sure. 6^1 is 6, 6^2 is 36, 6^3 is 216, 6^4 is 1296, 6^5 is 7776.

So 6^5 is 7776. Therefore, the probability is 3125 / 7776.

Is that the probability? Let me think again to ensure I haven't missed anything.

Yes, each die is independent, so the total outcomes are 6^5. For exactly one 6, we choose one die to be 6, which is 5 choices, and the rest must be non-6, which is 5 possibilities each. So 5 * 5^4 is indeed 5^5, which is 3125. So 3125 divided by 7776. Hmm.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: for each die, the probability of getting a 6 is 1/6, and not getting a 6 is 5/6.

So the probability of exactly one 6 is C(5,1

Alright, so I need to figure out the probability of getting exactly one 6 when rolling five dice. Hmm, let me start by thinking about probability basics. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, right? So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice would be \(6^5\) since each die has 6 possible outcomes, and they're independent.

Let me calculate that real quick: \(6^5 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 7776\). So, there are 7776 total possible outcomes when rolling five dice.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out how many favorable outcomes there are—meaning how many ways we can get exactly one 6 and four numbers that are not 6. Since we're dealing with dice, the numbers that are not 6 can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, each of those four dice has to show one of those five numbers.

I remember this is a combinatorial problem where we need to count the number of ways to choose which die shows the 6 and then count the number of ways the other dice can show non-6 numbers. So, first, I should figure out how many ways there are to choose which one of the five dice will show the 6. That's a combination problem because the order in which we choose the die doesn't matter.

The formula for combinations is \(C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\), where \(n\) is the total number of items, and \(k\) is the number of items to choose. In this case, \(n = 5\) and \(k = 1\), so:

\(C(5, 1) = \frac{5!}{1!(5 - 1)!} = \frac{5!}{1!4!} = \frac{5 \times 4!}{1 \times 4!} = 5\). So, there are 5 ways to choose which die will show the 6.

Now, for each of the remaining four dice, they can show any number from 1 to 5, right? So, each of those four dice has 5 possible outcomes. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for each of those four dice is \(5^4\). Let me calculate that: \(5^4 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 625\).

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose which die is the 6 multiplied by the number of ways the other dice can show non-6 numbers. So, that would be \(5 \times 625 = 3125\).

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. So, 5 choices for which die is 6, and for each of those, 5^4 for the other dice. 5 * 625 is indeed 3125. So, 3125 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is \( \frac{3125}{7776} \).

Hmm, can that fraction be simplified? Let me see. 3125 and 7776. Let's factor both numbers.

3125: I know that 5^5 is 3125 because 5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125.

7776: Let me think. 7776 divided by 6 is 1296. 1296 divided by 6 is 216. 216 divided by 6 is 36. 36 divided by 6 is 6. 6 divided by 6 is 1. So, 7776 is 6^5, which is 6*6*6*6*6. But if I break it down into prime factors, 6 is 2*3, so 6^5 is (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5. So, 7776 = 2^5 * 3^5.

Now, 3125 is 5^5, and 7776 is 2^5 * 3^5. They don't have any common factors other than 1, so the fraction can't be simplified further. Therefore, the probability is \( \frac{3125}{7776} \).

Let me just think if I did everything correctly. So, choosing 1 die out of 5 to be 6 is 5 ways, each of the remaining 4 dice
