<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the proper divisors of 36, which are the numbers that divide 36 exactly without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

Starting from 1, which divides every number, the next divisor is 2, then 3, 4, and 6. 

Continuing, 9 is also a divisor since 36 divided by 9 equals 4. Next, 12 is a divisor because 36 divided by 12 is 3, and 18 divides evenly as 36 divided by 18 is 2.

After listing all the proper divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18, I'll proceed to add them together.

Finally, I'll calculate the sum to find that the total of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proper Divisors of 36

A **proper divisor** of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. Let's list all proper divisors of 36:

1. **1** (since 1 × 36 = 36)
2. **2** (2 × 18 = 36)
3. **3** (3 × 12 = 36)
4. **4** (4 × 9 = 36)
5. **6** (6 × 6 = 36)
6. **9** (9 × 4 = 36)
7. **12** (12 × 3 = 36)
8. **18** (18 × 2 = 36)

### Step 2: Sum the Proper Divisors

Now, add all the proper divisors together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
\]

Let's perform the addition step by step:

\[
1 + 2 = 3
\]
\[
3 + 3 = 6
\]
\[
6 + 4 = 10
\]
\[
10 + 6 = 16
\]
\[
16 + 9 = 25
\]
\[
25 + 12 = 37
\]
\[
37 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer

The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors are the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

I'll start by listing the numbers that multiply together to give 36. The prime factorization of 36 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \). Using this, I can determine the divisors by combining the prime factors in different ways.

The proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Next, I'll add these numbers together to find their sum.

Calculating the sum: \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 37 \).

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proper Divisors
A **proper divisor** of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. Let's list all proper divisors of **36**:

- **1** (since \( 36 \div 1 = 36 \))
- **2** (since \( 36 \div 2 = 18 \))
- **3** (since \( 36 \div 3 = 12 \))
- **4** (since \( 36 \div 4 = 9 \))
- **6** (since \( 36 \div 6 = 6 \))
- **9** (since \( 36 \div 9 = 4 \))
- **12** (since \( 36 \div 12 = 3 \))

So, the proper divisors of **36** are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12**.

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Add all the proper divisors together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 37
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{37}
\]
