<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I will find all the positive divisors of 36 by checking which numbers divide 36 without leaving a remainder. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 36.

Next, I need to determine which of these divisors are proper. A proper divisor is a positive divisor of a number excluding the number itself. So, the proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12.

Finally, I will calculate the sum of these proper divisors by adding them together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12, which equals 37.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors of 36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify all divisors of 36
A **divisor** of a number is an integer that can be multiplied by another integer to produce the original number.

Let's list all positive divisors of 36:
\[
1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12, \ 18, \ 36
\]

### Step 2: Determine the proper divisors
A **proper divisor** is a positive divisor of a number excluding the number itself. Therefore, the proper divisors of 36 are:
\[
1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of proper divisors
Now, add up all the proper divisors:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 37
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{37}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors are numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

I'll start by listing the divisors in pairs that multiply to 36. The pairs are (1, 36), (2, 18), (3, 12), and (4, 9). From these pairs, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12.

Next, I'll add these proper divisors together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12. 

Calculating the sum step by step: 1 + 2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 6 is 16, plus 9 is 25, and finally, adding 12 gives a total of 37.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proper Divisors of 36
Proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. Let's list them:

- **1** (since \(1 \times 36 = 36\))
- **2** (since \(2 \times 18 = 36\))
- **3** (since \(3 \times 12 = 36\))
- **4** (since \(4 \times 9 = 36\))
- **6** (since \(6 \times 6 = 36\))

So, the proper divisors of 36 are:  
\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12\)

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Now, add all the proper divisors together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12
\]

Let's compute step by step:

\[
1 + 2 = 3 \\
3 + 3 = 6 \\
6 + 4 = 10 \\
10 + 6 = 16 \\
16 + 9 = 25 \\
25 + 12 = 37
\]

### Final Answer
The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:

\[
\boxed{37}
\]
