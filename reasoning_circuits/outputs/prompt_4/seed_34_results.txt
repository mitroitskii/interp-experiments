<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure what proper divisors are exactly. Wait, I think they are the divisors of a number excluding the number itself. Yeah, that sounds right. So for 36, I need to list all the numbers that divide into it without leaving a remainder, and then add them up, except for 36 itself.

Alright, let me start by figuring out what all the divisors of 36 are. A good way to find divisors is to list out the numbers that multiply together to make 36. I remember that 36 can be broken down into prime factors. Let me try that first.

The prime factors of 36 are... well, 36 divided by 2 is 18, then 18 divided by 2 is 9, 9 divided by 3 is 3, and then 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, the prime factors are 2^2 * 3^2. Hmm, right. So the exponents are 2 and 2 for primes 2 and 3 respectively.

Now, using the prime factorization, I can find all the divisors. There's a formula or method for that, right? I think it's something where you take each exponent, add 1 to them, and then multiply those together. So, for 2^2, that's 3, and for 3^2, that's also 3. So, 3 multiplied by 3 is 9. Does that mean there are 9 divisors in total? Let me verify by listing them.

Starting from 1, since 1 divides every number. Then 2, because 36 is even. 3 because 3+9=12, which is still less than 36. 4, since 36 divided by 4 is 9. 6, because 6 is a factor of 36. 9 comes next, because 9 times 4 is 36. Then 12, because 12 times 3 is 36. 18, because 18 times 2 is 36. And finally, 36 itself. So the divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

Wait, that's nine divisors. So if the proper divisors exclude 36, I need to subtract that. So, the proper divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. Now, I need to add these up.

Let me do that step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

Starting with 1, add 2: 1 + 2 = 3.

Then add 3: 3 + 3 = 6.

Next, add 4: 6 + 4 = 10.

Add 6: 10 + 6 = 16.

Add 9: 16 + 9 = 25.

Add 12: 25 + 12 = 37.

Add 18: 37 + 18 = 55.

Wait a second, 1+2 is 3, +3 is 6, +4 is 10, +6 is 16, +9 is 25, +12 is 37, +18 is 55. So the total sum of the proper divisors is 55.

Hold on, did I do that correctly? Let me check another way. Maybe there's a formula for the sum of divisors. If I recall correctly, the sum of the divisors of a number can be calculated using the prime factorization. The formula is like for each prime, you take the sum from the 0th power up to its exponent, multiply them together.

So for 36, which is 2^2 * 3^2, the sum of its divisors should be (1 + 2 + 4) * (1 + 3 + 9). Let me compute that.

First, 1 + 2 + 4 is 7. Then 1 + 3 + 9 is 13. So 7 * 13 is 91. That's the sum of all divisors, including 36. Therefore, the sum of proper divisors is 91 - 36, which is 55. Okay, that matches my previous result. So that's a good check.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding earlier. Let's add them again:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that a proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number exactly without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list all the numbers less than 36 that divide 36 without any remainder and then add them up. 

First, maybe I should figure out what the divisors of 36 are. I think the best way to do that is to perform prime factorization on 36. Let me recall how prime factorization works. I have to break down 36 into its prime number components. 

Starting with the smallest prime, which is 2. 36 divided by 2 is 18. Okay, so 2 is a factor. Then, 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, 2 is a factor again. Now, 9 isn't divisible by 2, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. 9 divided by 3 is 3. So, 3 is a factor. Then, 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3. 

Wait, another way to write that is 2 squared times 3 squared, right? So, 36 = 2² × 3². I think that's correct because 2² is 4, and 3² is 9, and 4 times 9 is 36. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, I remember there's a formula for the sum of divisors based on the prime factorization. I think it's something like for each prime factor, you take the sum of the powers from 0 up to the exponent in the prime factorization and multiply them together. Let me try to recall.

If a number N can be expressed as a product of primes, like N = p₁^a × p₂^b × ... × pₙ^k, then the sum of all divisors of N is (1 + p₁ + p₁² + ... + p₁^a) × (1 + p₂ + p₂² + ... + p₂^b) × ... × (1 + pₙ + pₙ² + ... + pₙ^k). 

So, applying that to 36, which is 2² × 3², the sum of all divisors would be (1 + 2 + 4) × (1 + 3 + 9). Let me calculate that. 

First, 1 + 2 + 4 is 7, and 1 + 3 + 9 is 13. Then, 7 multiplied by 13 is 91. So, the sum of all divisors of 36 is 91. But wait, the question asks for the sum of all proper divisors. Hmm, okay. So, proper divisors exclude the number itself. Therefore, I need to subtract 36 from this sum.

So, 91 minus 36 is 55. Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55. 

But hold on, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, maybe I should list out all the proper divisors of 36 and add them up manually. Let me try that.

Starting from 1, since 1 is a divisor of every number. Then, 2 divides 36 because 36 is even. 3 divides 36 because the sum of the digits is 9, which is divisible by 3. 4 divides 36 because 36 divided by 4 is 9. 6 divides 36 because both 2 and 3 are divisors. 9 divides 36 because 36 divided by 9 is 4. 12 divides 36 because 36 divided by 12 is 3. 18 divides 36 because 36 divided by 18 is 2. 

Wait, let me check if I missed any. So, starting from 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. Is that all? Let me think. 5 doesn't divide 36 because 36 ends with a 6, but 5 doesn't go into 36 evenly. 7? 36 divided by 7 is about 5.14, which isn't an integer. 8? 36 divided by 8 is 4.5, so no. 10? 36 divided by 10 is 3.6, not an integer. 11? 36 divided by 11 is roughly 3.27, no
