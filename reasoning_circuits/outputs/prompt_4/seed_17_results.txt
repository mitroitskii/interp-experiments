<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me think about what that means. First, what exactly are proper divisors? I remember that a divisor is a number that can divide into another number without leaving a remainder. Proper divisors, specifically, are all the divisors of a number excluding the number itself. So for 36, I need to list all numbers that can divide into 36 evenly, but I shouldn't include 36 in that list.

Alright, let's start by listing all the divisors of 36. I can do this by checking numbers from 1 up to 36 and seeing which ones divide evenly into 36. But that might take a while. Maybe there's a smarter way to do this, especially if I need to find the sum.

Wait, I think there's a formula for the sum of divisors, which is called the sigma function in mathematics. The sigma function, σ(n), gives the sum of all positive divisors of n, including n itself. If I can find σ(36), then I can subtract 36 from that sum to get the sum of the proper divisors.

Okay, so how do I compute σ(36)? I think it involves prime factorization. Let me recall that method. So, I should first express 36 as a product of prime numbers raised to their respective exponents.

36 can be broken down like this: 36 = 6 × 6. And 6 is 2 × 3, so 36 = (2 × 3) × (2 × 3). But writing it with exponents, 36 is 2² × 3². So, the prime factors are 2 and 3, with exponents 2 and 2, respectively.

The formula for the sum of divisors, σ(n), when n is expressed as a product of primes like p₁^k₁ × p₂^k₂ × ... × p_m^k_m, is given by multiplying the sum of each prime's powers from 0 up to k. In other words, σ(n) = (1 + p₁ + p₁² + ... + p₁^k₁) × (1 + p₂ + p₂² + ... + p₂^k₂) × ... × (1 + p_m + p_m² + ... + p_m^k_m).

Applying that to 36's prime factorization, which is 2² × 3², we can compute σ(36) as:

σ(36) = (1 + 2 + 2²) × (1 + 3 + 3²)

Let me calculate each part step by step. First, for the prime 2 with exponent 2:

1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Then for the prime 3 with exponent 2:

1 + 3 + 9 = 13.

Now, multiplying those two results together: 7 × 13 = 91.

So, σ(36) is 91. But remember, this is the sum of all divisors, including 36 itself. Since we want only the proper divisors, we subtract 36 from 91.

91 - 36 = 55.

So, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me list all the proper divisors of 36 and add them up to see if it totals 55.

Starting with the smallest divisor, 1. Then 2 (since 36 ÷ 2 = 18). Then 3 (36 ÷ 3 = 12). Next, 4 (36 ÷ 4 = 9). Then 6 (36 ÷ 6 = 6). After that, 9 (36 ÷ 9 = 4). 12 (36 ÷ 12 = 3). 18 (36 ÷ 18 = 2). Wait, should I include 18? Because 18 is a proper divisor, yes, because it's less than 36.

Wait a second, 36 ÷ 18 is 2, so 18 is a proper divisor.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any. Let me list them systematically.

Start by finding all numbers less than 36 that divide evenly into 36. So, the pairs would be:

1 and 36,

2 and 18,

3 and 12,

4 and 9,

6 and 6.

So, from these pairs, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18. Let me count them to make sure: 1,2,3,4

Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me think about what that means. First, what exactly are proper divisors? I remember that a divisor of a number is another number that can divide into it without leaving a remainder. Proper divisors, specifically, are all the divisors except the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list all numbers that can divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36.

Alright, let's start by listing all the divisors of 36. Maybe I can do this systematically. The number 36 is not too large, so this shouldn't take too long. I know that 1 is always a divisor of any number, so 1 is definitely on the list. Then, checking 2: 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 and 18 are both divisors. Next, 3: 36 divided by 3 is 12, so 3 and 12 are divisors. Moving on to 4: 36 divided by 4 is 9, so 4 and 9 are divisors. What about 5? 36 divided by 5 is 7.2, which isn't a whole number, so 5 is not a divisor.

Next, 6: 36 divided by 6 is 6, so 6 is a divisor. Wait, but 6 squared is 36, so does that mean 6 is only counted once? Yeah, because it's the square root, so it's only a single divisor. Let's see, after 6, the next number is 7: 36 divided by 7 is about 5.14, which isn't a whole number, so 7 isn't a divisor. 8: 36 divided by 8 is 4.5, not a whole number. 9: we've already got that from 4 times 9.

What about 10? 36 divided by 10 is 3.6, not a whole number. 11: 36 divided by 11 is about 3.27, nope. 12: we've got that from 3. 13: 36 divided by 13 is roughly 2.769, nope. 14: 36 divided by 14 is around 2.571, not a whole number. 15: 36 divided by 15 is 2.4, which isn't a whole number. 16: 36 divided by 16 is 2.25, nope. 17: 36 divided by 17 is about 2.117, nope. 18: we have that from 2.

So, listing all the divisors I've found so far: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. Wait, but 36 is the number itself, and proper divisors exclude the number itself, so we need to exclude 36. That leaves us with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Now, I need to sum these up. Let me do this step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake. Starting with 1, then adding 2: 1 + 2 = 3. Then adding 3: 3 + 3 = 6. Next, add 4: 6 + 4 = 10. Then add 6: 10 + 6 = 16. After that, add 9: 16 + 9 = 25. Next, add 12: 25 + 12 = 37. Finally, add 18: 37 + 18 = 55.

Wait, so the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55? Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything or add incorrectly. Let me list the proper divisors again: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. That's eight numbers. Now, adding them:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

Yep, that seems right. Hmm, but wait, I feel like 36 might have a special property here. I remember that perfect numbers have the sum of their proper divisors equal to themselves. Let me check: 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, and their sum
