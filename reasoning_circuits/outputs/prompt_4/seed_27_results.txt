<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, proper divisors are all the numbers that divide 36 evenly, except for 36 itself, right? So first, maybe I should figure out what all the divisors of 36 are and then add them up without including 36. 

Let me start by recalling that 36 is a composite number because it can be broken down into smaller numbers. I know that 1 is always a divisor of any number. So 1 is definitely a proper divisor. Then, 2 divides into 36 because 36 is even. Let me check: 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 and 18 are also divisors. Next, 3 divides into 36 because 3 times 12 is 36. So, 3 and 12 are divisors too.

Moving on, 4 divides into 36 since 4 times 9 is 36, so 4 and 9 are divisors. Then 5, does that divide into 36? Let's see, 36 divided by 5 is 7.2, which isn't a whole number, so 5 isn't a divisor. How about 6? Yes, 6 times 6 is 36, so 6 is a divisor. Let me list all of the divisors I have so far: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. I think that's all the divisors.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed any. Starting from 1 up to half of 36, which is 18. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. Yep, that seems right. So the proper divisors would exclude 36 itself, so they are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now I need to add them up. Let me write them down: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. Let me add them step by step to minimize errors. 

Starting with 1 and 2: 1 + 2 is 3. Then 3 + 3 is 6. Wait, that might not be the best way. Maybe I should pair them to make it easier. Let me pair the smallest with the largest.

So, 1 and 18: 1 + 18 = 19.

Then, 2 and 12: 2 + 12 = 14.

Next, 3 and 9: 3 + 9 = 12.

Lastly, 4 and 6: 4 + 6 = 10.

Now I have the sums: 19, 14, 12, and 10. Adding those together: 19 + 14 is 33, 33 + 12 is 45, and 45 + 10 is 55.

Wait, is that right? Let me add them again step by step without pairing. 

Adding in order:

1 (current total: 1)

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

Okay, same result. So that seems to be consistent. Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

Alternatively, I remember there's a formula called the sum of divisors function, which can be used for this kind of problem. It's called σ(n), and for a number n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, where p1, p2, ..., pk are prime factors, the sum of divisors is the product of (1 + p + p² + ... + p^a) for each prime.

But wait, for proper divisors, we have to subtract n itself from σ(n). So maybe I can use this approach as well to verify my answer.

First, let's factorize 36. 36 is 6 squared, which is (2*3)^2, so the prime factors are 2^2 and 3^2. Therefore, the prime factorization is 2^2 * 3^2.

Using the sum of divisors function σ(36), it's (1 + 2 + 4) * (1 + 3 + 9). Calculating that:

First part: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Second part:

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that proper divisors are all the divisors of a number excluding the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36. Then, I'll add them all up.

First, let me recall what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that can divide into it without leaving a remainder. For example, 6 is a divisor of 36 because 36 divided by 6 is 6, which is an integer. Similarly, 9 is a divisor of 36 because 36 divided by 9 is 4, which is also an integer. So, I need to find all such numbers for 36.

I think the best way to find all divisors is to start by finding the prime factors of 36, and then use those to determine all possible divisors. Let me try that.

Starting with 36, I can divide it by 2 to get 18. Then, 18 divided by 2 is 9. Now, 9 is not divisible by 2, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. Dividing 9 by 3 gives me 3, and then 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, 3, or in exponential form, \(2^2 \times 3^2\).

Now, to find all the divisors, I can use the exponents of the prime factors. For each prime, the exponent can range from 0 up to its power in the prime factorization. So, for 2, the exponents can be 0, 1, or 2. For 3, the exponents can be 0, 1, or 2.

This means that the total number of divisors is (2+1)*(2+1) = 9. Let me list them out by taking each combination of exponents:

1. \(2^0 \times 3^0 = 1\)
2. \(2^0 \times 3^1 = 3\)
3. \(2^0 \times 3^2 = 9\)
4. \(2^1 \times 3^0 = 2\)
5. \(2^1 \times 3^1 = 6\)
6. \(2^1 \times 3^2 = 18\)
7. \(2^2 \times 3^0 = 4\)
8. \(2^2 \times 3^1 = 12\)
9. \(2^2 \times 3^2 = 36\)

Okay, so all the divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. But since we're looking for proper divisors, we exclude 36. So, the proper divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now, I need to sum these up. Let me add them one by one:

Start with 1.

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check my addition step by step:

First, 1 + 2 = 3.

Then, 3 + 3 = 6.

Next, 6 + 4 = 10.

Then, 10 + 6 = 16.

16 + 9 = 25.

25 + 12 = 37.

37 + 18 = 55.

Hmm, so the sum is 55? Let me verify by adding them in a different order to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me group them:

1 and 36: but 36 is excluded, so 1.

2 and 18: 2 + 18 = 20.

3 and 12: 3 + 12 = 15.

4 and 9: 4 + 9 = 13.

6 is left alone.

So, adding those together: 1 + 20 + 15 + 13 + 6.

1 + 20 = 21.

21 + 15 = 36.

36 + 13 = 49.

49 + 6 = 55.

Hmm
