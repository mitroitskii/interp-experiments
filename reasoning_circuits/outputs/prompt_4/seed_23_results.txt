<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors are the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

Starting from 1, since 1 is a proper divisor of every number. Next, I check 2, which divides 36 evenly, so 2 is also a proper divisor. I continue this process up to the square root of 36 to find all divisors efficiently. I find that the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Once I have all the proper divisors, the next step is to add them together. I'll add them sequentially: 1 plus 2 equals 3, plus 3 equals 6, plus 4 equals 10, plus 6 equals 16, plus 9 equals 25, plus 12 equals 37, and finally, plus 18 equals 55.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proper Divisors:**

   Proper divisors of a number are the divisors excluding the number itself. Let's list all proper divisors of 36:

   \[
   1, \, 2, \, 3, \, 4, \, 6, \, 9, \, 12, \, 18
   \]

2. **Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors:**

   Add the listed proper divisors:

   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
   \]

   Compute the sum step-by-step:

   \[
   1 + 2 = 3
   \]
   \[
   3 + 3 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 + 4 = 10
   \]
   \[
   10 + 6 = 16
   \]
   \[
   16 + 9 = 25
   \]
   \[
   25 + 12 = 37
   \]
   \[
   37 + 18 = 55
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   The sum of all proper divisors of **36** is:

   \[
   \boxed{55}
   \]

Starting from 1, since 1 is a proper divisor of every number. Next, I check 2, which divides 36 evenly. Then, 3 also divides 36 without a remainder. Continuing this process, I find that 4, 6, and 9 are also proper divisors of 36.

After listing all the proper divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9, I can calculate their sum by adding them together.

Finally, adding these numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 equals 25.
