<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, okay. Let me remember what proper divisors are. I think they are the divisors of a number excluding the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36. Then, I'll add them up. 

Let me start by recalling what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that can divide it without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 1 is a divisor of every number, right? So, 1 is definitely going to be one of the proper divisors of 36. 

Now, 36 is the number we're dealing with here. Let's list the numbers that multiply together in pairs to give 36. I remember that factors come in pairs, and each pair multiplies to the original number. So, starting with 1, since 1 x 36 = 36, but 36 is the number itself, so we won't include that. 

Next, 2: 2 x 18 = 36. Okay, so 2 is a proper divisor and 18 is another proper divisor. Then, 3: 3 x 12 = 36, so both 3 and 12 are proper divisors. Moving on, 4: 4 x 9 = 36, so 4 and 9. After that, 6: 6 x 6 = 36, so 6 is a divisor, but wait, 6 is multiplied by itself. So, does that count twice? Or just once? I think it's only listed once because it's repeated. So, we still have 6 as a proper divisor, right?

Let me try to list them all systematically. Starting from 1:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

But since we're only looking for proper divisors, we exclude 36. So, the proper divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Okay, now I need to add these up. Let's do that step by step to avoid mistakes.

Starting with 1:

1 + 2 = 3.

3 + 3 = 6.

6 + 4 = 10.

10 + 6 = 16.

16 + 9 = 25.

25 + 12 = 37.

37 + 18 = 55.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my addition because sometimes I make little mistakes when adding sequentially.

Let me add them again:

1 + 2 = 3.

3 + 3 = 6.

6 + 4 = 10.

10 + 6 = 16.

16 + 9: Hmm, 16 + 9 is 25, right? Because 16 + 10 is 26, so subtracting 1 gives 25. Okay, so that's correct.

25 + 12: 25 + 10 is 35, plus 2 is 37. Correct.

37 + 18: 37 + 20 is 57, minus 2 is 55. So, yes, the total sum is 55.

Wait, hold on a second. I think I might be missing a proper divisor. Let me list the factors again to ensure I have them all.

Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. So, excluding 36, as per proper divisors, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. That's eight numbers.

Adding them again:

1 + 2 = 3.

3 + 3 = 6.

6 + 4 = 10.

10 + 6 = 16.

16 + 9 = 25.

25 + 12 = 37.

37 + 18 = 55.

Same result. So, perhaps it's correct.

But I recall that there's a formula for the sum of proper divisors called the aliquot sum. For a number n, it's the sum of its proper divisors. There's also a formula related to the number's prime factorization.

Let me recall the formula. If n can be expressed as n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, then the sum of its divisors (including itself) is (1 + p1 + p1^2 + ... + p1^a1) * (1 + p2 + p2

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to figure out the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, okay. Let me think about what proper divisors are first. If I remember correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, but it's not the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 6 would be 1, 2, and 3, right? Because 6 divided by 1 is 6, divided by 2 is 3, and divided by 3 is 2. But we don't include 6 itself. Got it.

So, applying that to 36, I need to list all the numbers that can divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself. Let me start by listing the divisors of 36. I think the best way to do this is to find all the numbers that multiply together in pairs to give 36. Let me see:

1 and 36: 1 x 36 = 36. So, 1 and 36 are divisors.
2 and 18: 2 x 18 = 36. So, 2 and 18 are divisors.
3 and 12: 3 x 12 = 36. So, 3 and 12 are divisors.
4 and 9: 4 x 9 = 36. So, 4 and 9 are divisors.
6 and 6: 6 x 6 = 36. So, 6 is a divisor as well, but since it's paired with itself, we only count it once.

Wait, but when listing proper divisors, we exclude the number itself, which is 36. So, from the list above, the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. But since we're only looking for proper divisors, we take all except 36. So, the proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Now, I need to find the sum of these numbers. Let me add them one by one to make sure I don't miss any:

1 + 2 = 3
3 + 3 = 6
6 + 4 = 10
10 + 6 = 16
16 + 9 = 25
25 + 12 = 37
37 + 18 = 55

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the addition step by step:

Starting with 1:
1 (total: 1)

Adding 2: 1 + 2 = 3 (total: 3)
Adding 3: 3 + 3 = 6 (total: 6)
Adding 4: 6 + 4 = 10 (total: 10)
Adding 6: 10 + 6 = 16 (total: 16)
Adding 9: 16 + 9 = 25 (total: 25)
Adding 12: 25 + 12 = 37 (total: 37)
Adding 18: 37 + 18 = 55 (total: 55)

Hmm, so according to this, the sum is 55. But I have a feeling I might be missing something here because 55 doesn't seem like a very familiar number for the sum of proper divisors of 36. Let me think again.

Wait a second, maybe there's a smarter way to calculate the sum of proper divisors without listing each one. I remember something about the formula for the sum of divisors. Let me recall. If a number is expressed as its prime factorization, say N = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then the sum of all divisors of N is (1 + p1 + p1^2 + ... + p1^a1) * (1 + p2 + p2^2 + ... + p2^a2) * ... * (1 + pn + pn^2 + ... + pn^an). So, the sum of all divisors, including N itself, is the product of these terms.

Therefore, if I want the sum of proper divisors, I can take the sum of all divisors and subtract N. That sounds like a good method, especially if dealing with larger numbers where listing all divisors might be tedious.

So, let me apply this to 36. First, let's find its prime factorization.

36 is 6 squared, which is (2*3)^2, which is 2^2 * 3^2. So, N =
