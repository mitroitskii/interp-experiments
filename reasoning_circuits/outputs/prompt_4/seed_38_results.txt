<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me think. First off, what exactly are proper divisors? I remember they are the divisors of a number excluding the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list all numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36. Then, I have to add those numbers together. That makes sense.

Alright, starting with the basics. I should probably list all the divisors of 36 first and then exclude 36 from that list. Divisors are numbers that can divide 36 evenly. To make this easier, maybe I can start by finding the prime factors of 36 because that often helps in finding all divisors.

I remember that 36 is a perfect square. Let me try dividing it by prime numbers. Starting with the smallest prime, 2. 36 divided by 2 is 18. Then, 18 can be divided by 2 again to get 9. Okay, so 2 is a prime factor, and we have 2 squared so far. Now, 9 is not divisible by 2, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. 9 divided by 3 is 3, and 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, the prime factors of 36 are 2 squared times 3 squared. That means 36 can be written as 2² × 3².

Now, to find all the divisors of 36, I can use the exponents of the prime factors. The formula for the number of divisors is (exponent of 2 + 1) multiplied by (exponent of 3 + 1). So, (2+1)(2+1) = 3×3=9. Therefore, there are 9 divisors of 36. But wait, proper divisors exclude the number itself, so it's 8 proper divisors.

But do I really need to list all of them or can I use a shortcut? Since I know the prime factors, maybe I can list all possible combinations of the prime factors and their products. Each exponent of 2 can be 0, 1, or 2, and each exponent of 3 can be 0, 1, or 2. Let me try that.

So, starting with 2^0: That gives us 1. Then multiplying by 3^0, 3^1, or 3^2.

- 2^0 × 3^0 = 1 × 1 = 1
- 2^0 × 3^1 = 1 × 3 = 3
- 2^0 × 3^2 = 1 × 9 = 9

Now, 2^1: That gives us 2. Multiplying by 3^0, 3^1, or 3^2.

- 2^1 × 3^0 = 2 × 1 = 2
- 2^1 × 3^1 = 2 × 3 = 6
- 2^1 × 3^2 = 2 × 9 = 18

Next, 2^2: That gives us 4. Multiplying by 3^0, 3^1, or 3^2.

- 2^2 × 3^0 = 4 × 1 = 4
- 2^2 × 3^1 = 4 × 3 = 12
- 2^2 × 3^2 = 4 × 9 = 36

So, listing all these out, the divisors of 36 are: 1, 3, 9, 2, 6, 18, 4, 12, 36. Wait, hold on, did I list them in order? No, I think I messed that up. Let me order them from smallest to largest: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

Yep, that looks correct because each subsequent number is double or triple the previous one, except maybe not entirely, but 6 is 3 times 2, but 9 is 3 squared. So, seems like all the combinations are there.

But since we need proper divisors, we have to exclude 36. So, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. Okay, so I need to sum these numbers. Let me line them up and add them step by step.

First, I'll list them out:

1, 2,

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me think about what that means. First, what exactly are proper divisors? I remember that a proper divisor of a number is a divisor that isn't the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 6 would be 1, 2, and 3 because 6 is excluded. 

Alright, so applying that to 36, I need to list all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36 itself. Let me start by finding all the divisors of 36 and then I'll exclude 36 from the list. 

To find the divisors, I can start by breaking down 36 into its prime factors. I know that 36 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 36 by 2: 36 ÷ 2 = 18. Okay, 18 is still even, so divide by 2 again: 18 ÷ 2 = 9. Now, 9 is divisible by 3: 9 ÷ 3 = 3, and then 3 ÷ 3 = 1. So, the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3, which can be written as 2² × 3².

Now, to find all the divisors, I can use the exponents of the prime factors. If a number has a prime factorization of the form p^a × q^b, the total number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1). So for 36, which is 2² × 3², the number of divisors is (2+1)(2+1) = 9. That means there are 9 divisors in total. 

But I don't need all the divisors, just the proper ones, so I need to subtract one from that total. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The total number of divisors includes 1 and the number itself, so if I have 9 divisors, the proper divisors would be 9 - 1 = 8. Hmm, actually, that makes sense because 36 is included in the total count, so if I subtract one, I get the proper divisors.

But maybe I should list them out to make sure I don't miss any. Let me list all the divisors of 36 first. Starting from 1, since 1 is a divisor of every number. Then, since 36 is even, 2 is a divisor. 36 ÷ 2 = 18, so 18 is also a divisor. Then, 3: 36 ÷ 3 = 12, so 3 and 12 are divisors. Next, 4: 36 ÷ 4 = 9, so 4 and 9 are divisors. Then, 6: 36 ÷ 6 = 6, so 6 is a divisor. Wait, that's a perfect square, so 6 is the square root of 36. So, do I need to include that? Yes, because 6 is a proper divisor. 

Let me list them all out:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

Yep, that's 9 divisors. So, the proper divisors are all of these except 36. So, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18. 

Now, I need to find the sum of these proper divisors. Let me add them up one by one.

Starting with 1, then add 2: 1 + 2 = 3. Then add 3: 3 + 3 = 6. Next, add 4: 6 + 4 = 10. Then, add 6: 10 + 6 = 16. Add 9: 16 + 9 = 25. Then, add 12: 25 + 12 = 37. Next, add 18: 37 + 18 = 55.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my addition because 55 seems a bit high. Let me add them in a different order or pair them up to see if I get the same result.

Let me pair 1 and 36, but wait, 36 isn't included. So, maybe pair 1 with 18, 2 with 9, 3 with 12, and 4 with 6. But since 36 isn't included, let me see.

Wait, maybe
