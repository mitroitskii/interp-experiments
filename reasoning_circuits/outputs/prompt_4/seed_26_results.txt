<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I recognize that to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I need to identify all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

I'll start by listing the divisors of 36. Since 36 is an even number, 2 is a divisor. By multiplying 2 by 18, I get 36, so 18 is also a divisor. Similarly, 3 and 12 are divisors, and 4 and 9 round out the complete list of divisors.

Next, I'll sum these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18. Adding these together gives 55.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the proper divisors of 36:**
   
   Proper divisors are numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

   - Start by listing the numbers that multiply together to give 36:
     \[
     1 \times 36,\, 2 \times 18,\, 3 \times 12,\, 4 \times 9,\, 6 \times 6
     \]
   - From these pairs, identify the proper divisors (excluding 36):
     \[
     1,\, 2,\, 3,\, 4,\, 6,\, 9,\, 12,\, 18
     \]

2. **Calculate the sum of these proper divisors:**
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
   \]
   
   Let's add them step by step:
   \[
   1 + 2 = 3 \\
   3 + 3 = 6 \\
   6 + 4 = 10 \\
   10 + 6 = 16 \\
   16 + 9 = 25 \\
   25 + 12 = 37 \\
   37 + 18 = 55
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{55}
   \]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the prime factors of 36. Breaking it down, 36 can be divided by 2 to get 18, then by 2 again to get 9. Next, I divide 9 by 3 to get 3, and finally by 3 again to get 1. So, the prime factors are \(2^2 \times 3^2\).

Using the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \((1 + p + p^2 + \dots + p^n)\) for each prime factor \(p\) raised to the power \(n\), I'll calculate the sum of the divisors. For 2 with an exponent of 2, the sum is \(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\). For 3 with an exponent of 2, the sum is \(1 + 3 + 9 = 13\). Multiplying these results gives \(7 \times 13 = 91\), which is the sum of all divisors of 36.

However, the question asks for the sum of all proper divisors. Proper divisors exclude the number itself, so I'll subtract 36 from the total sum of divisors. Therefore, the sum of proper divisors is \(91 - 36 = 55\).

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Prime Factorization of 36
First, express 36 as a product of prime numbers.

\[
36 = 2^2 \times 3^2
\]

### Step 2: Use the Formula for the Sum of Divisors
The formula to find the sum of all divisors (including the number itself) of a number \( n = p^a \times q^b \) is:

\[
\text{Sum of divisors} = (1 + p + p^2 + \dots + p^a) \times (1 + q + q^2 + \dots + q^b)
\]

Applying this to 36:

- For the prime factor **2** with exponent 2:
  \[
  1 + 2 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
  \]

- For the prime factor **3** with exponent 2:
  \[
  1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13
  \]

Multiply these results to get the total sum of divisors:
\[
7 \times 13 = 91
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the Number Itself to Find the Sum of Proper Divisors
Proper divisors exclude the number itself. Therefore, subtract 36 from the total sum of divisors:

\[
\text{Sum of proper divisors} = 91 - 36 = 55
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{55}
\]
