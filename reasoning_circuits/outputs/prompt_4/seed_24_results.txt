<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem: What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36? Hmm, okay, let me figure this out step by step. I remember that divisors are numbers that divide another number without leaving a remainder, right? So, for example, 1 divides every number, and the number itself is also a divisor.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for proper divisors. Hmm, what's the difference between a proper divisor and a regular divisor? I think a proper divisor is a divisor that is not the number itself. So, for 36, its divisors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. But the proper divisors would exclude 36, so we're looking at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Got it. So, I need to add all these numbers up: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18. Let me calculate this step by step.

First, 1 + 2 is 3. Then, 3 + 3 is 6. Next, 6 + 4 is 10. Hmm, wait, let me do this more carefully to avoid mistakes.

Starting over:

1 (first term)

1 + 2 = 3 (after adding the second term)

3 + 3 = 6 (third term)

6 + 4 = 10 (fourth term)

10 + 6 = 16 (fifth term)

16 + 9 = 25 (sixth term)

25 + 12 = 37 (seventh term)

37 + 18 = 55 (eighth term)

Wait, but I feel like 36 has a more interesting sum of proper divisors. Maybe there's a formula instead of adding them all up manually?

I remember something about the sum of divisors function in number theory. For a number, especially if it's prime factorized, you can use the formula to find the sum of its divisors. Since 36 isn't a prime number, it has several factors, but it might be a power of a prime or something.

Let me try prime factorizing 36. So, 36 divided by 2 is 18. 18 divided by 2 is 9. 9 divided by 3 is 3, and then 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, 36 = 2^2 * 3^2.

I think the formula for the sum of divisors is if a number N = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then the sum of its divisors is (1 + p1 + p1^2 + ... + p1^a1) multiplied by (1 + p2 + p2^2 + ... + p2^a2) and so on for each prime factor.

So, applying this to 36, which is 2^2 * 3^2. The sum of divisors would be (1 + 2 + 4) * (1 + 3 + 9). Let me compute that.

First part: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Second part: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.

Then, 7 * 13 is 91.

But wait, that's the sum of all divisors of 36, including itself. So, if I want the sum of proper divisors, I need to subtract 36 from this total.

So, 91 (sum of all divisors) minus 36 (the number itself) is 55.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

Just to double-check, let me add them again manually to make sure I didn't make a mistake before.

1 + 2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 6 is 16, plus 9 is 25, plus 12 is 37, plus 18 is 55. Yep, that matches.

So, either way, whether I use the formula or add them manually, the sum is 55. I feel confident about that.

But just to make sure I understand the concept, let's recap. Proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For 36, those are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18. Their sum is 55. So, 55 is the answer.

I wonder, is there any shortcut for finding the sum of proper divisors without

Okay, so I have this problem: What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that divisors are numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder. Proper divisors, if I'm not mistaken, are all the divisors except the number itself. So, for 36, I need to find all the numbers that can divide it evenly and then add them up, but not including 36.

First, maybe I should list out all the divisors of 36. To do that, I can start by finding its prime factors. I know that 36 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 36 by 2 gives me 18. 18 is also even, so dividing by 2 again gives me 9. Now, 9 is not even, so I'll try dividing by 3. 9 divided by 3 is 3, and then 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3. In exponential form, that's 2² × 3².

Now, to find all the divisors, I can use the prime factors. If a number has a prime factorization of p^a × q^b, then the number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1). In this case, that would be (2+1)(2+1) = 9 divisors. Let me list them out: starting from 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. So, that's 9 divisors in total.

But the question asks for proper divisors, which means I need to exclude 36. So, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18. Now, I need to sum these up. Let me do that step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

Starting with 1, then adding 2 gives me 3. Adding 3 brings it to 6. Then, adding 4 makes it 10. Next, adding 6 gives me 16. Adding 9, that's 25. Then, adding 12 brings it up to 37. Adding 18, the total becomes 55. Hmm, wait, let me verify that again because I might have messed up the addition somewhere.

Let me try adding them in pairs to see if that helps. 1 and 18 make 19. 2 and 9 make 11. 3 and 6 make 9. 4 and 12 make 16. So, adding those together: 19 + 11 is 30, plus 9 is 39, plus 16 is 55. Okay, same result. Maybe I should add them in another way to cross-verify.

Alternatively, I can list them in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. Let's add them sequentially:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

Still 55. Hmm, seems consistent.

Wait, another thought: I remember there's a formula for the sum of divisors based on the prime factorization. Maybe I can use that to double-check. The formula is: for a number n = p^a × q^b × r^c..., the sum of divisors is (1 + p + p² + ... + p^a)(1 + q + q² + ... + q^b)(1 + r + r² + ... + r^c)... So, for 36, which is 2² × 3², the sum of all divisors should be (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 3 + 9). Let me compute that.

First, (1 + 2 + 4) = 7.

Then, (1 + 3 + 9) = 13.

Multiplying 7 × 13 gives 91. So, the sum of all divisors of 36 is 91. But that includes 36 itself. Therefore, the sum of proper divisors would be 91 minus 36, which is 55. Okay, that matches my previous result. So, that must be correct.

Alternatively, I can think about the proper divisors as all the divisors except the number itself.
