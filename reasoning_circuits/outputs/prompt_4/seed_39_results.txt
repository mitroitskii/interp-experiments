<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, okay. Let me make sure I understand the question correctly. Proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list out all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36. Then, I have to add all those numbers together. Got it.

First, maybe I should start by finding all the divisors of 36. Divisors are numbers that when multiplied together give 36. Let me see, I can start by listing numbers that multiply together to get 36. Starting from 1 and going up, checking which ones divide 36 without a remainder.

1 is always a divisor of any number, right? So, 1 divides 36. Okay, next, 2. 36 divided by 2 is 18, which is an integer. So, 2 is a divisor. Next, 3. 36 divided by 3 is 12. That's also an integer, so 3 is a divisor. What about 4? 36 divided by 4 is 9. Still an integer, so 4 is a divisor.

5? Hmm, 36 divided by 5 is 7.2, which isn't an integer, so 5 isn't a divisor. 6? 36 divided by 6 is 6. That's an integer, so 6 is a divisor. Next, 7. 36 divided by 7 is about 5.142, so not a divisor. 8? 36 divided by 8 is 4.5, which isn't an integer. So, 8 isn't a divisor either.

Moving on to 9. 36 divided by 9 is 4, so that's a divisor. 10? 36 divided by 10 is 3.6, not an integer, so 10 isn't a divisor. 11? 36 divided by 11 is approximately 3.27, so nope, not a divisor. 12? 36 divided by 12 is 3. So, 12 is a divisor.

13? 36 divided by 13 is around 2.769, which isn't an integer. 14? 36 divided by 14 is about 2.571, also not an integer. 15? 36 divided by 15 is 2.4, so no. 16? 36 divided by 16 is 2.25, still not an integer. 17? 36 divided by 17 is roughly 2.117, not a divisor.

18? 36 divided by 18 is 2, which is an integer, so 18 is a divisor. 19? 36 divided by 19 is approximately 1.894, not a divisor. 20? 36 divided by 20 is 1.8, which isn't an integer. 21? 36 divided by 21 is about 1.714, so no. 22? 36 divided by 22 is around 1.636, not a divisor.

23? 36 divided by 23 is about 1.565, not an integer. 24? 36 divided by 24 is 1.5, which is 1.5, not an integer. 25? 36 divided by 25 is 1.44, nope. 26? 36 divided by 26 is roughly 1.384, not a divisor.

27? 36 divided by 27 is approximately 1.333, so that's not an integer either. 28? 36 divided by 28 is about 1.285, no. 29? 36 divided by 29 is about 1.241, not a divisor. 30? 36 divided by 30 is 1.2, still not an integer.

31? 36 divided by 31 is roughly 1.161, so nope. 32? 36 divided by 32 is 1.125, which is 1.125, not a divisor. 33? 36 divided by 33 is around 1.09, so no. 34? 36 divided by 34 is approximately 1.058, not an integer. 35? 36 divided by 35 is about 1.028, still not a divisor.

And finally, 36 divided by 36 is 1, but since we're only looking for proper divisors, we exclude 36. So, that's all of them. Let me list out the divisors I found: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12

First, I need to determine all the proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors are the numbers that divide 36 exactly without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

I'll start by listing the numbers from 1 to 35 and check which ones divide 36 evenly.

1 divides 36 because any number is divisible by 1.

2 divides 36 because 36 divided by 2 equals 18, which is an integer.

3 divides 36 because 36 divided by 3 equals 12, which is an integer.

4 divides 36 because 36 divided by 4 equals 9, which is an integer.

6 divides 36 because 36 divided by 6 equals 6, which is an integer.

9 divides 36 because 36 divided by 9 equals 4, which is an integer.

12 divides 36 because 36 divided by 12 equals 3, which is an integer.

18 divides 36 because 36 divided by 18 equals 2, which is an integer.

So, the proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Next, I'll sum these proper divisors:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand Proper Divisors
- **Proper divisors** of a number are the divisors excluding the number itself.
- For **36**, we need to find all numbers that divide **36** exactly, excluding **36**.

### Step 2: List All Proper Divisors of 36
Let's list all numbers that divide **36** without leaving a remainder:

1. **1** (Since 1 divides every number)
2. **2** (36 ÷ 2 = 18)
3. **3** (36 ÷ 3 = 12)
4. **4** (36 ÷ 4 = 9)
5. **6** (36 ÷ 6 = 6)
6. **9** (36 ÷ 9 = 4)
7. **12** (36 ÷ 12 = 3)
8. **18** (36 ÷ 18 = 2)

**Proper Divisors of 36:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18

### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Now, add all these proper divisors together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{55}
\]
