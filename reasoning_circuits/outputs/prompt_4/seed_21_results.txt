<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To determine the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I start by listing all of its divisors.

First, I identify the prime factors of 36, which are 2 and 3. Knowing this, the exponents for 2 can range from 0 to 2, and for 3, they can range from 0 to 2. This gives me the complete list of divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

Next, I exclude 36 itself because the question asks for proper divisors. This leaves me with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Finally, I add these remaining divisors together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18. Calculating this sum gives me 55.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 36
First, express 36 as a product of prime numbers:

\[
36 = 2^2 \times 3^2
\]

### Step 2: List All Divisors of 36
Using the prime factorization, list all possible combinations of the prime factors:

\[
1, \quad 2, \quad 3, \quad 4, \quad 6, \quad 9, \quad 12, \quad 18, \quad 36
\]

### Step 3: Identify Proper Divisors
Proper divisors are all divisors of the number excluding the number itself. Therefore, the proper divisors of 36 are:

\[
1, \quad 2, \quad 3, \quad 4, \quad 6, \quad 9, \quad 12, \quad 18
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Add all the proper divisors together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer
The sum of all proper divisors of **36** is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To determine the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I start by listing all of its divisors.

First, I find the prime factors of 36, which are 2, 2, 3, and 3. This means the total number of divisors is (2+1)(2+1) = 9.

Next, I list all the divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

Finally, I exclude 36 itself and sum the remaining proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand Proper Divisors
Proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself.

### Step 2: List All Divisors of 36
First, find all divisors of 36:

- **Prime Factorization of 36**:
  \[
  36 = 2^2 \times 3^2
  \]
  
- **Total Number of Divisors**:
  \[
  (2+1)(2+1) = 9 \text{ divisors}
  \]
  
- **List of Divisors**:
  \[
  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
  \]

### Step 3: Exclude the Number Itself
Proper divisors exclude the number itself. So, exclude **36**.

- **Proper Divisors of 36**:
  \[
  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Add all the proper divisors:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{55}
\]
