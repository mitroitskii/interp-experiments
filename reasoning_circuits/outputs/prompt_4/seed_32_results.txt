<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me start by recalling what proper divisors are. If I remember correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. So, for 36, I need to find all the numbers less than 36 that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, and then add them up.

Alright, to do this systematically, maybe I can start by finding all the divisors of 36 and then subtract 36 from the sum. Yeah, that makes sense. So, first, let me list all the divisors of 36.

I know that 1 is always a divisor of any number. So, 1 is one of them. Then, 36 divided by 1 is 36, but since we're only counting proper divisors, I shouldn't include 36. Next, let's see what other numbers divide evenly into 36.

Starting with 2, 36 divided by 2 is 18. So, 2 and 18 are divisors. Moving on, 3 divided into 36 is 12, so 3 and 12 are divisors. Then, 4 times 9 is 36, so 4 and 9 are divisors. 5 times 7.2 is 36, but 7.2 isn't an integer, so 5 is not a divisor. 6 times 6 is 36, so 6 is a divisor. 7 isn't a divisor because 36 divided by 7 is about 5.14, which isn't an integer.

After 6, the divisors should mirror the ones before. Let me check: 12 is already a divisor, 18 is next, which we've already listed, and 36 is excluded. So, the list of all divisors is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

Since I'm looking for proper divisors, I need to exclude 36 from this list. So, the proper divisors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now, I need to sum these numbers. Let me write them down and add step by step:

1 + 2 = 3
3 + 3 = 6
6 + 4 = 10
10 + 6 = 16
16 + 9 = 25
25 + 12 = 37
37 + 18 = 55

Wait, so the total sum is 55? Let me check my addition because I don't want to make a mistake here.

1 + 2 is definitely 3. Then adding 3 gives 6, okay. 6 plus 4 is 10, right. Then 10 plus 6 is 16. Adding 9 makes it 25, yes. Then 25 plus 12 is 37, and then 37 plus 18 is 55. Hmm, that seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let me pair the divisors to make adding easier. Sometimes, adding pairs can help ensure I don't miss anything. So, the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Pairing 1 and 18: 1 + 18 = 19
Pairing 2 and 12: 2 + 12 = 14
Pairing 3 and 9: 3 + 9 = 12
Pairing 6 and 4: 6 + 4 = 10

Wait, hold on, that's different. Let me see: 1 + 18 is 19, 2 + 12 is 14, 3 + 9 is 12, 6 + 4 is 10.

Now, adding those results: 19 + 14 = 33, 33 + 12 = 45, 45 + 10 = 55. Oh, same result. So, that confirms that my previous sum was correct. So, the sum of all proper divisors is 55.

But wait, just to make sure I didn't miss any divisors, let me try listing all the numbers from 1 up to 18 and see which ones divide 36.

1: Yes, 36 ÷ 1 = 36.
2: Yes, 36 ÷ 2 = 18.
3: Yes, 36 ÷ 3 = 12.
4: Yes, 36 ÷ 4 = 9.
5: 36 ÷ 5 = 7.2, which is not

Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me start by recalling what proper divisors are. If I remember correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. So, for 36, I need to find all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36. Then, I have to add those numbers together to get the sum. 

First, maybe I should list out all the divisors of 36. To do that, I can start by finding its prime factorization. I think the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3 because 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9, and then 9 divided by 3 is 3, and divided by 3 again is 1. So, that means 36 = 2² × 3². 

Now, if I have the prime factors, I can find all the divisors by taking each prime factor and multiplying them in all possible combinations. The exponents for 2 are 0, 1, 2 and for 3 are also 0, 1, 2. So, let me list them out:

- For 2⁰ (which is 1):
  - 3⁰ = 1, so 1×1 = 1
  - 3¹ = 3, so 1×3 = 3
  - 3² = 9, so 1×9 = 9

- For 2¹ (which is 2):
  - 3⁰ = 1, so 2×1 = 2
  - 3¹ = 3, so 2×3 = 6
  - 3² = 9, so 2×9 = 18

- For 2² (which is 4):
  - 3⁰ = 1, so 4×1 = 4
  - 3¹ = 3, so 4×3 = 12
  - 3² = 9, so 4×9 = 36

So, all the divisors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

But wait, proper divisors exclude the number itself, which is 36. So, the proper divisors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now, I need to sum these up. Let me add them step by step:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

Hmm, so the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55. Let me double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I remember there's a formula for the sum of divisors based on the prime factorization. If a number N is expressed as N = p₁^a × p₂^b × ... × pₙ^k, then the sum of all divisors is (1 + p₁ + p₁² + ... + p₁^a)(1 + p₂ + p₂² + ... + p₂^b)...(1 + pₙ + pₙ² + ... + pₙ^k). 

But since we want the sum of proper divisors, we subtract the number itself from this total. So, for 36, which is 2² × 3², the sum of all divisors would be (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 3 + 9). Let's calculate that:

(1 + 2 + 4) = 7

(1 + 3 + 9) = 13

Then, 7 × 13 = 91. So, the sum of all divisors is 91. Therefore, the sum of proper divisors is 91 - 36 = 55. That matches what I got earlier, so I think I'm confident that 55 is the correct answer.

Just to make sure, I can also add the proper
