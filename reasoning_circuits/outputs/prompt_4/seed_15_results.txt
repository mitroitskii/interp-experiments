Input message: What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?

--- Sampling (temp=1.0) ---
<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the divisors of 36. Starting from 1, I check which numbers divide 36 evenly. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 36.

Next, I recognize that proper divisors are all the divisors of a number excluding the number itself. So, the proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12.

Finally, to find the sum of these proper divisors, I add them together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12, which equals 37.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors of 36**, let's follow these steps:

1. **List All Divisors of 36:**
   
   A proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

   The divisors of 36 are:
   \[
   1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12, \ 36
   \]
   
   However, since we're only interested in **proper divisors**, we exclude 36.
   
   So, the proper divisors are:
   \[
   1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 6,\ 9,\ 12
   \]

2. **Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors:**
   
   Now, let's add them together:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 37
   \]
   
3. **Final Answer:**
   
   The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:
   \[
   \boxed{37}
   \]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the divisors of 36. Starting from 1, I check which numbers divide 36 without leaving a remainder. The divisors I find are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

Next, I'll exclude the number itself, which is 36, since the question asks for proper divisors. This leaves me with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Now, I'll add these remaining numbers together to find the sum of all proper divisors. Adding them step by step: 1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 3 = 6, 6 + 4 = 10, 10 + 6 = 16, 16 + 9 = 25, 25 + 12 = 37, and 37 + 18 = 55.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **List all divisors of 36:**
   
   A proper divisor of a number is a divisor other than the number itself. Let's list all divisors of 36:
   
   \[
   1, \, 2, \, 3, \, 4, \, 6, \, 9, \, 12, \, 18, \, 36
   \]
   
   Now, exclude **36** (since it's the number itself):
   
   \[
   1, \, 2, \, 3, \, 4, \, 6, \, 9, \, 12, \, 18
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of these proper divisors:**
   
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
   \]
   
   Let's add them step by step:
   
   \[
   1 + 2 = 3 \\
   3 + 3 = 6 \\
   6 + 4 = 10 \\
   10 + 6 = 16 \\
   16 + 9 = 25 \\
   25 + 12 = 37 \\
   37 + 18 = 55
   \]
   
3. **Final Answer:**
   
   The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:
   
   \[
   \boxed{55}
   \]
