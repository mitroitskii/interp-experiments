<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me first recall what a proper divisor is. From what I remember, a proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, but it's not the number itself. So for 36, I need to list all the numbers that divide 36 evenly except for 36 itself and then add them all up.

Alright, let's start by listing all the divisors of 36. To do that, maybe I can find the prime factorization of 36 first. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. So, breaking down 36:

36 can be divided by 2. 36 ÷ 2 = 18.

18 can also be divided by 2. 18 ÷ 2 = 9.

Now, 9 is not divisible by 2, so let's try the next prime number, which is 3. 9 ÷ 3 = 3.

And 3 is still divisible by 3, so 3 ÷ 3 = 1.

So, putting that all together, the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3, which can be written as 2² × 3².

From the prime factorization, I can find all the divisors. I think the formula for finding the number of divisors is to add one to each of the exponents in the prime factors and then multiply those together. But here, I don't just need the number of divisors, I need to list them. Alternatively, I can systematically list all the possible products of these prime factors.

Given the prime factors 2² × 3², the exponents for 2 can be 0, 1, or 2, and for 3, also 0, 1, or 2. Each combination of these exponents will give me a different divisor. So:

- For 2: 2⁰, 2¹, 2²
- For 3: 3⁰, 3¹, 3²

Now, combining these:

1. 2⁰ × 3⁰ = 1 × 1 = 1
2. 2⁰ × 3¹ = 1 × 3 = 3
3. 2⁰ × 3² = 1 × 9 = 9
4. 2¹ × 3⁰ = 2 × 1 = 2
5. 2¹ × 3¹ = 2 × 3 = 6
6. 2¹ × 3² = 2 × 9 = 18
7. 2² × 3⁰ = 4 × 1 = 4
8. 2² × 3¹ = 4 × 3 = 12
9. 2² × 3² = 4 × 9 = 36

So, the divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

But, since we're looking for proper divisors, we need to exclude 36 itself. So, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Now, to find the sum of these proper divisors, I just need to add them all together. Let's do that step by step:

Start with 1.

1 + 2 = 3.

3 + 3 = 6.

6 + 4 = 10.

10 + 6 = 16.

16 + 9 = 25.

25 + 12 = 37.

37 + 18 = 55.

Wait, let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't skip any numbers or make a mistake.

Starting again:

1 (current sum)

Add 2: 1 + 2 = 3

Add 3: 3 + 3 = 6

Add 4: 6 + 4 = 10

Add 6: 10 + 6 = 16

Add 9: 16 + 9 = 25

Add 12: 25 + 12 = 37

Add 18: 37 + 18 = 55

Hmm, same result. So, is 55 the correct sum? Let me verify by adding them in a different order, maybe pairing numbers that add up to easier sums.

Pair them:

1 and 18: 1 + 18 = 19

2 and 9: 2 + 9 =

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a proper divisor is. If I remember correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a divisor that isn't the number itself. So, for 36, I need to find all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36 itself, and then add them up.

First, maybe I should list out all the divisors of 36. That should make it easier to figure out which ones are proper. To find the divisors, I can start by breaking down 36 into its prime factors. Let me think, 36 can be divided by 2 first. So, 36 divided by 2 is 18. Then, 18 divided by 2 is 9. Okay, so I have 2 times 2 times 9. Now, 9 can be broken down into 3 times 3. So, putting it all together, the prime factors of 36 are 2 squared times 3 squared. In exponent form, that's \(2^2 \times 3^2\).

Now, to find all the divisors, I can use the prime factorization. The formula for the number of divisors is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factors and then multiply them together. So, for 36, that would be (2 + 1) times (2 + 1), which is 3 times 3, giving 9 divisors in total. But since we're only looking for proper divisors, we'll subtract one to exclude 36 itself. So, there should be 8 proper divisors.

Let me list them out systematically. Starting from 1, since 1 is a divisor of every number. Then, 2 divides into 36 because it's even. 3 also divides into 36 because the sum of the digits is 9, which is divisible by 3. 4 divides into 36 because 36 divided by 4 is 9, which is an integer. 6 is next because 36 divided by 6 is 6. 9 is also a divisor, as we saw earlier. 12 is next because 36 divided by 12 is 3. 18 is another one because 36 divided by 18 is 2. And finally, 36 itself, which we exclude. So, the proper divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any. Starting from 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18... Hmm, that seems right. Let me check if each of these actually divides 36 without a remainder. 

1 divided by 36 is 36, which is an integer, so that's fine.
2 divided into 36 gives 18, which is an integer.
3 divided into 36 gives 12, which is an integer.
4 divided into 36 gives 9, which is an integer.
6 divided into 36 gives 6, which is an integer.
9 divided into 36 gives 4, which is an integer.
12 divided into 36 gives 3, which is an integer.
18 divided into 36 gives 2, which is an integer.

Okay, so all of those are indeed divisors. So, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now, I need to sum these up. Let me do that step by step to avoid mistakes. Starting with 1 and 2: 1 + 2 is 3. Then, add 3: 3 + 3 is 6. Next, add 4: 6 + 4 is 10. Then, add 6: 10 + 6 is 16. Now, add 9: 16 + 9 is 25. Next, add 12: 25 + 12 is 37. Then, add 18: 37 + 18 is 55.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the addition. Maybe I missed a step somewhere. Let's write them down and add them column-wise:

1  
2  
3  
4  
6  
9  
12  
18  

Adding them:

1 + 2 = 3  
3 + 3 = 6  
6 + 4 = 10  
10 + 6 = 16  
16 + 9 = 25  
25 + 12 = 37  
37 + 18 = 55.

Hmm, still getting 55.
