<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I recognize that to find the sum of all proper divisors of a number, I need to list out all its divisors.

I'll start by identifying the prime factors of 36. Factoring it, I get \(36 = 2^2 \times 3^2\).

Using the formula for the sum of divisors, \((1 + 2 + 2^2) \times (1 + 3 + 3^2)\), which equals \(7 \times 13 = 91\). However, this includes the number itself, so I'll subtract 36 from 91 to get the sum of the proper divisors, which is 55.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **Understand Proper Divisors:**
   
   Proper divisors of a number are all the positive integers that divide the number exactly, **excluding the number itself**.

2. **Find All Divisors of 36:**

   First, identify all divisors of 36:
   
   \[
   1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 6,\ 9,\ 12,\ 18,\ 36
   \]
   
3. **Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors:**
   
   Exclude **36** itself from the list of divisors and sum the remaining numbers:
   
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   
   The sum of all proper divisors of **36** is:
   
   \[
   \boxed{55}
   \]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the positive divisors of 36.

Starting with 1, since 1 is a divisor of every number.

Next, I'll check 2, which divides 36 evenly because 36 divided by 2 is 18.

Then, I'll consider 3, which also divides 36 evenly, as 36 divided by 3 is 12.

Moving on to 4, 36 divided by 4 is 9, so 4 is a divisor.

For 6, 36 divided by 6 is 6, making 6 a divisor.

Finally, 9 divides 36 evenly because 36 divided by 9 is 4.

Now, I'll list all the proper divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

To find the sum of these divisors, I'll add them together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 equals 25.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **Identify all positive divisors of 36:**
   
   A proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

   - **1** (since 1 divides every number)
   - **2** (36 ÷ 2 = 18)
   - **3** (36 ÷ 3 = 12)
   - **4** (36 ÷ 4 = 9)
   - **6** (36 ÷ 6 = 6)
   - **9** (36 ÷ 9 = 4)
   
   So, the proper divisors of 36 are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9**.

2. **Calculate the sum of these proper divisors:**
   
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of **36** is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
