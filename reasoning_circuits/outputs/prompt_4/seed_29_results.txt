<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here: What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36? Hmm, I need to figure this out. First off, let me make sure I know what a proper divisor is. If I remember right, a proper divisor of a number is a divisor that isn't the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 6 would be 1, 2, and 3 because 6 itself isn't included. Got it.

Alright, so I need to find all the proper divisors of 36 and then add them up. 36 is not a prime number, so it must have several divisors. Maybe I can list them out. Let me think about how to find all the divisors of a number efficiently. I remember that for a given number, if you know its prime factorization, it's easier to find all divisors.

So, let's start by finding the prime factors of 36. I think 36 can be divided by 2 first. So, 36 divided by 2 is 18. Then, 18 divided by 2 is 9. Okay, so 2 times 2 is 4. Now, 9 isn't divisible by 2, so I can move to the next prime number, which is 3. Dividing 9 by 3 gives me 3, and then dividing 3 by 3 gives 1. So, the prime factors of 36 are 2^2 * 3^2. That's 2 squared times 3 squared.

Now, if a number's prime factorization is known, the total number of divisors can be found by adding one to each of the exponents and multiplying them together. In this case, the exponents are 2 and 2, so (2+1)*(2+1) = 9. So, 36 has 9 divisors in total. But since we're only looking for proper divisors, we'll exclude 36 itself. So, 9 minus 1 is 8. There are 8 proper divisors.

Let me list them out. Starting from 1, since 1 is always a divisor. Then, 2, because 36 divided by 2 is 18, which is an integer. 3, since 36 divided by 3 is 12. 4? Yes, because 36 divided by 4 is 9. 6, because 36 divided by 6 is 6. 9 is next, as 36 divided by 9 is 4. 12? Yes, 36 divided by 12 is 3. 18? Because 36 divided by 18 is 2. So, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Wait, let me double-check that I didn't miss any or include any extras. Starting from 1: yes. Then 2, 3, 4, 6. Then 9, 12, 18. That's eight numbers. So, that looks correct.

Now, I need to add all of these together to find the sum of proper divisors. Let me write them down again: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Let's start adding step by step:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

So, adding them up gives me 55.

Wait, hold on. Let me do that addition again because 55 seems a bit high or maybe it's correct. Sometimes I miscalculate when adding. Let me use a different method, maybe pairing the numbers or adding in another order.

Let me pair the largest and smallest divisors:

1 + 18 = 19

2 + 12 = 14

3 + 9 = 12

4 + 6 = 10

Now, adding those sums together: 19 + 14 = 33, 33 +12=45, 45 +10=55. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the sum of divisors. I remember that if a number has the prime factorization of n = p^a * q^b * r^c..., then the sum of its divisors is (1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^a)(1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^b)(1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^c)...

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me think about what that means. Proper divisors are all the divisors of a number excluding the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36.

First, maybe I should figure out all the divisors of 36. To do that, I can start by finding its prime factors. I remember that prime factorization helps in finding all the divisors. Let me try to break down 36.

36 divided by 2 is 18. 18 divided by 2 is 9. 9 isn't divisible by 2, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. 9 divided by 3 is 3, and then 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, the prime factors of 36 are 2^2 * 3^2. 

Now, to find all the divisors, I can use the exponents of the prime factors. The formula for the number of divisors is (exponent of 2 + 1) * (exponent of 3 + 1). So, that would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 divisors in total. Let me list them out to make sure.

Starting from 1: 1 is always a divisor. Then, 2 because it's even. 3 because the sum of digits is 9, which is divisible by 3. 4, since 36 divided by 4 is 9, which is an integer. 6 because it's divisible by both 2 and 3. 9, as we saw earlier. 12, 18, and 36.

Wait, let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. Yep, that's 9 divisors. Now, since proper divisors exclude the number itself, I need to exclude 36. So, the proper divisors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now, I need to sum these up. Let me add them step by step:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

So, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55. Hmm, let me verify this another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

I remember there's a formula for the sum of divisors. If a number N has the prime factorization N = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then the sum of all divisors of N is (p1^0 + p1^1 + ... + p1^a1) * (p2^0 + p2^1 + ... + p2^a2) * ... * (pn^0 + pn^1 + ... + pn^an).

So, for 36, which is 2^2 * 3^2, the sum of all divisors would be (1 + 2 + 4) * (1 + 3 + 9). Calculating that:

(1 + 2 + 4) = 7

(1 + 3 + 9) = 13

7 * 13 = 91

So, the sum of all divisors, including 36, is 91. Since the proper divisors exclude 36, I need to subtract 36 from this sum. 91 - 36 = 55. 

Okay, that matches the sum I got earlier. So, that seems correct.

Another way to think about it: the proper divisors of a number are the numbers that divide it except itself. So, maybe I can pair them up in a way that makes addition easier. Let's see:

1 and 36: Wait, 36 is excluded, so 1 is alone.

2 and 18: 2 + 18 = 20

3 and 12: 3 + 12 = 15

4 and 9: 4 + 9 = 13

6 is in the middle. So, adding all these up:

1 + (2 + 18) + (3 + 12) + (4 + 9) + 6

Calculating each bracket:

1 + 20 + 15 + 13 + 6

Adding step by step:
