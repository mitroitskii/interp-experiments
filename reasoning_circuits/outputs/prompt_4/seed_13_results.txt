<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a proper divisor is. From what I remember, a proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, but it's not the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 36 would be the numbers that can divide 36 evenly, excluding 36. Got it.

Alright, first step, I should probably list out all the proper divisors of 36. To do that, I need to find all the numbers that can multiply together in pairs to give me 36. Let me think. The number 36 can be broken down into prime factors. I remember that prime factorization is the process of breaking down a number into the product of its prime numbers. So, let's do that.

Starting with 36, I know that it's even, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 36 by 2 gives me 18. 18 is also even, so dividing by 2 again gives me 9. Now, 9 is not even, but it's divisible by 3. Dividing 9 by 3 gives me 3, and then 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, 3, or in exponential form, \(2^2 \times 3^2\). Got that.

Now, knowing the prime factors, I can find all the divisors. To list all the divisors, I can use the prime factors. The formula for finding the number of divisors is \((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)...(e_n + 1)\) where \(e_i\) are the exponents in the prime factorization. So, for 36, which is \(2^2 \times 3^2\), the number of divisors is \((2+1)(2+1) = 9\). So, there are 9 divisors in total.

Wait, that's actually 9 divisors, including 36 itself. So, the proper divisors would be 9 minus 1, right? So, 8 proper divisors. Let me list them out to make sure. Starting from 1:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Yes, eight proper divisors. Perfect.

Now, I need to find the sum of these proper divisors. So, I can either add them one by one, which might take longer, or use a formula. Wait, I think there is a formula for the sum of divisors which might help here. For a number n with prime factorization \(n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times ... \times p_k^{e_k}\), the sum of all positive divisors of n is given by the product of the sums of each prime power from 0 up to its exponent.

So, in other words, the sum of all divisors is \((1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + ... + p_1^{e_1}) \times (1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + ... + p_2^{e_2}) \times ... \times (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + ... + p_k^{e_k})\).

Therefore, if I can compute that and then subtract n itself to get the sum of proper divisors, that should work.

Let me apply that to 36.

Given the prime factorization \(36 = 2^2 \times 3^2\), the sum of all divisors would be:

\[
(1 + 2 + 4) \times (1 + 3 + 9)
\]

Calculating each part separately:

For the 2s: \(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\).

For the 3s: \(1 + 3 + 9 = 13\).

Multiplying those together: \(7 \times 13 = 91\).

So, the sum of all divisors, including 36, is 91. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors is 91 minus 36, which is 55.

But let me double-check by adding the divisors manually to ensure I haven't missed anything.

The proper divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a proper divisor is. If I remember correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, but it's not the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list all the numbers that can divide 36 evenly except for 36.

Alright, let me try to list all the divisors of 36 first. I think the best way to do this is to start from 1 and go up, checking which numbers divide 36 without a remainder. 

Starting with 1: 36 divided by 1 is 36, so 1 is a divisor.

Next, 2: 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 is a divisor.

3: 36 divided by 3 is 12, so 3 is a divisor.

4: 36 divided by 4 is 9, so 4 is a divisor.

5: 36 divided by 5 is 7.2, which isn't a whole number, so 5 isn't a divisor.

6: 36 divided by 6 is 6, so 6 is a divisor. Wait, that's 6 times 6, so 6 is a divisor, but 6 squared is 36, so 6 is a perfect square divisor.

7: 36 divided by 7 is about 5.14, which isn't a whole number, so 7 isn't a divisor.

8: 36 divided by 8 is 4.5, which isn't a whole number, so 8 isn't a divisor.

9: 36 divided by 9 is 4, so 9 is a divisor.

10: 36 divided by 10 is 3.6, not a whole number, so 10 isn't a divisor.

11: 36 divided by 11 is approximately 3.27, not a whole number, so 11 isn't a divisor.

12: 36 divided by 12 is 3, so 12 is a divisor.
