<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I first need to identify what proper divisors are. Proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself.

Next, I'll list all the positive integers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder. Starting from 1 and working upwards, the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9, and finally, 36 itself.

Since proper divisors exclude the number itself, I'll remove 36 from the list. This leaves me with the proper divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

Finally, I'll add these proper divisors together to find their sum. Adding them step by step: 1 plus 2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 6 is 16, and finally, adding 9 gives a total sum of 25.

To find the sum of **all proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Understand Proper Divisors**
A **proper divisor** of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

### **Step 2: List All Divisors of 36**
First, find all the divisors of 36:
- 1 (because 36 ÷ 1 = 36)
- 2 (because 36 ÷ 2 = 18)
- 3 (because 36 ÷ 3 = 12)
- 4 (because 36 ÷ 4 = 9)
- 6 (because 36 ÷ 6 = 6)
- 9 (because 36 ÷ 9 = 4)
- 12 (because 36 ÷ 12 = 3)
- 18 (because 36 ÷ 18 = 2)
- 36 (because 36 ÷ 36 = 1)

### **Step 3: Exclude the Number Itself**
Proper divisors exclude the number itself. So, remove **36** from the list:
- **Proper Divisors of 36:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18

### **Step 4: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors**
Add all the proper divisors together:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
\]

### **Final Answer**
\[
\boxed{55}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by listing all the divisors of 36. A proper divisor is a number that divides 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

First, I'll find the prime factorization of 36, which is \(6^2\), so \(2^2 \times 3^2\). Using the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \((1 + p + p^2 + \dots + p^n)\) for each prime factor \(p\) raised to the power of \(n\), I'll calculate the sum of all divisors.

For the prime number 2 with the exponent 2, the sum is \(1 + 2 + 4\). For the prime number 3 with the exponent 2, the sum is \(1 + 3 + 9\). Multiplying these two sums together gives the total sum of all divisors: \( (1 + 2 + 4) \times (1 + 3 + 9) = 7 \times 13 = 91 \).

Since proper divisors exclude the number itself, I'll subtract 36 from the total sum of divisors: \(91 - 36 = 55\).

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand Proper Divisors
A **proper divisor** of a number is a positive integer that divides the number exactly, without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

### Step 2: List All Proper Divisors of 36
Let's list all the proper divisors of **36**:

- **1** (since 1 × 36 = 36)
- **2** (since 2 × 18 = 36)
- **3** (since 3 × 12 = 36)
- **4** (since 4 × 9 = 36)
- **6** (since 6 × 6 = 36)
- **9** (since 9 × 4 = 36)
- **12** (since 12 × 3 = 36)
- **18** (since 18 × 2 = 36)

So, the proper divisors of 36 are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Now, add up all the proper divisors:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
\]

Let's compute this step by step:

\[
1 + 2 = 3 \\
3 + 3 = 6 \\
6 + 4 = 10 \\
10 + 6 = 16 \\
16 + 9 = 25 \\
25 + 12 = 37 \\
37 + 18 = 55
\]

So, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is **55**.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{55}
\]
