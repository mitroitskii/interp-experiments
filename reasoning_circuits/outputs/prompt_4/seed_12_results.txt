<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let's start by recalling what a proper divisor is. From what I remember, a proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that can divide that number exactly without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 36 would be all the numbers that divide 36 except 36. That makes sense.

Alright, let me write down 36 first. The number is 36, which I know is not a prime number because it has several factors. To find the proper divisors, I think the best way is to list all the numbers that multiply together in pairs to make 36. Let's start by finding all the factors of 36.

I know that 1 is a divisor of every number, so 1 is definitely a proper divisor. Next, 2 divides into 36 because it's even. 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 and 18 are both divisors. Moving on, 3 divides into 36 as well because the sum of the digits is 9, which is divisible by 3. 36 divided by 3 is 12, so 3 and 12 are divisors. 

What about 4? Let me check. 4 times 9 is 36, so yes, 4 and 9 are divisors. Next, 5 doesn't divide into 36 because 36 divided by 5 is 7.2, which isn't a whole number, so 5 isn't a divisor. Moving on to 6. 6 times 6 is 36, so 6 is a divisor. 

Wait, that means 6 is paired with itself here. So, 6 is a divisor, but it's only counted once. What about 7? Let's see, 7 times what gives 36? Hmm, 36 divided by 7 is about 5.142, which isn't an integer, so 7 isn't a divisor either.

After 7, I can check if 8 divides into 36. 8 times 4.5 is 36, which again isn't an integer, so no. How about 9? We actually already considered that earlier because 9 was paired with 4. So, moving on, 10 doesn't divide because 36 divided by 10 is 3.6, not an integer.

Wait a second, maybe it's better if I list all the possible pairs systematically. So, starting from 1 and going up:

1 and 36
2 and 18
3 and 12
4 and 9
6 and 6

Okay, so these are all the factor pairs of 36. Each pair multiplies to 36, and the divisors are all the numbers in these pairs. So, listing all the divisors, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. 

But wait, we are asked for proper divisors, so we have to exclude 36. That leaves us with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now, I need to sum all these numbers. Let me write them out to add them one by one:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18.

I can add them step by step:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

Hmm, so the sum of the proper divisors is 55? Wait, let me check if I did that correctly, because 55 doesn't seem too big for 36.

Alternatively, another method is to use the formula for the sum of divisors. I remember that for a number, if you express it as its prime factorization, you can use a formula to compute the sum of its divisors, and then subtract the number itself to get the sum of the proper divisors.

So, let me try that method to verify.

First, prime factorization of 36. Let's see, 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9, which is 3 squared. So, 36 is 2 squared times 3 squared, or 2² * 3².

The formula for the sum of divisors function σ(n) for n = p₁^a₁ * p₂^a₂ * ... * p_k^a_k is (1

Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let's start by recalling what a proper divisor is. From what I remember, a proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, but it's not the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list all the numbers less than 36 that can divide it evenly and then add them up.

First, maybe I should list all the divisors of 36, including 36 itself, and then exclude it at the end. That seems like a good plan. To find the divisors, I can start by finding the prime factorization of 36 because that usually helps in identifying all the factors.

Okay, prime factorization of 36. Let me think. 36 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing by 2 gives me 18. 18 is also even, so divide by 2 again to get 9. Now, 9 is 3 squared, so that's 3 times 3. Putting it all together, the prime factors are 2 squared times 3 squared. So, 36 = 2² × 3².

Now, to find all the divisors, I can use the exponents of the prime factors. The formula for the number of divisors is (exponent of 2 + 1) multiplied by (exponent of 3 + 1). So, (2+1)(2+1) = 3×3 = 9 divisors in total. Let me list them out to make sure I have all.

Starting from 1, since 1 divides every number. Then 2, because 36 is even. 3, because the sum of digits is 9, which is divisible by 3. 4, since 36 divided by 4 is 9, which is an integer. 6, because both 2 and 3 are factors. 9, since we already have that as a prime factor. 12, because 36 divided by 12 is 3. 18, because 36 divided by 18 is 2. And finally, 36 itself.

So, the divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

But wait, the question asks for proper divisors, so I need to exclude 36. That leaves me with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now, I need to sum these up. Let me add them step by step:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

Hmm, so the sum is 55? Wait, let me verify that because I might have missed something or added incorrectly.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for the sum of divisors that I can use instead of listing them all out. Since I have the prime factorization, 36 = 2² × 3², the formula for the sum of divisors is (1 + 2 + 2²) × (1 + 3 + 3²). Let me compute that.

First part: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7

Second part: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13

Multiplying them together: 7 × 13 = 91

But wait, that's the sum of all divisors including 36. Since the question asks for proper divisors, I need to subtract 36 from this sum.

So, 91 - 36 = 55

Okay, so that confirms my earlier result. The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in listing the divisors, let me go through them again. Starting from 1 and going up:

1: divides 36, yes.

2: 36/2 = 18, integer, so yes.

3: 36/3 = 12, integer.

4: 36/4 = 9, integer.

6: 36/6 = 6, integer.

9: 36/9 = 4, integer.

12: 36/12 = 3, integer.

18: 36/18 = 2, integer.

36: itself, so we exclude.

Yep, that's all of them. So, 8 proper divisors, adding up to 55.

Alternatively, I can use another method: pairing the
