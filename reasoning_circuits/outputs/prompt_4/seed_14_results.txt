<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To determine the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by listing all of its positive divisors. A proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

36 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 36 by 2 gives 18. Checking if 18 is a divisor, I find that it divides evenly into 36, yielding 2. Repeating this process for 18, I get 9. Since 9 divided by 3 equals 3, and finally, 3 divided by 3 is 1, I can list all the divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

To find the sum of proper divisors, I'll exclude 36. Adding up the remaining numbers: 1 plus 2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 6 is 16, plus 9 is 25, plus 12 is 37, and finally, plus 18 is 55. Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **List all positive divisors of 36:**

   A proper divisor is a positive integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

   - Start with 1 and 36 (since 1 × 36 = 36).
   - 36 is divisible by 2 (2 × 18 = 36).
   - 18 is divisible by 2 (2 × 9 = 18).
   - 9 is divisible by 3 (3 × 3 = 9).
   - Continue listing all factors:
     \[
     1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
     \]

2. **Exclude 36** (since proper divisors do not include the number itself):
   \[
   \text{Proper divisors of 36: } 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18
   \]

3. **Sum the proper divisors:**
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{55}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To determine the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by listing all of its positive divisors. 

First, I'll find the prime factors of 36 by breaking it down into its prime components. 

Next, I'll use the formula for the sum of divisors, which involves multiplying the sum of each prime factor raised to one less than its highest power by the product of all the prime factors raised to one less than their highest powers.

Finally, I'll subtract 36 from this sum to obtain the sum of the proper divisors.
