<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I first need to identify what a proper divisor is. A proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

Next, I'll list all the proper divisors of 36. Starting from 1, I'll check which numbers evenly divide into 36:
- 1 divides 36 because 36 ÷ 1 = 36.
- 2 divides 36 because 36 ÷ 2 = 18.
- 3 divides 36 because 36 ÷ 3 = 12.
- 4 divides 36 because 36 ÷ 4 = 9.
- 6 divides 36 because 36 ÷ 6 = 6.

After listing them out, the proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.

Finally, to find the sum of these proper divisors, I'll add them together:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 equals 16.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 16.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand Proper Divisors
A **proper divisor** of a number is a positive integer that can divide the number without leaving a remainder, **excluding the number itself**. 

### Step 2: List All Proper Divisors of 36
Let's list all the proper divisors of **36**:

- **1** (since 36 ÷ 1 = 36)
- **2** (since 36 ÷ 2 = 18)
- **3** (since 36 ÷ 3 = 12)
- **4** (since 36 ÷ 4 = 9)
- **6** (since 36 ÷ 6 = 6)
  
**Note:** We **exclude 36** itself from the list of proper divisors.

### Step 3: Sum the Proper Divisors
Now, add up all the proper divisors we identified:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16
\]

### Final Answer
The sum of all proper divisors of **36** is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by identifying the number's prime factors. 36 can be factored into \(2^2 \times 3^2\).

Using the formula for the sum of divisors, \(\sigma(n) = (1 + p + p^2 + \dots + p^k)\) for each prime power \(p^k\) in the factorization, I'll calculate the sum of all divisors, including 36 itself.

For the prime factor 2 with exponent 2, the sum is \(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\).

For the prime factor 3 with exponent 2, the sum is \(1 + 3 + 9 = 13\).

Multiplying these sums together gives the total sum of all divisors: \(7 \times 13 = 91\).

Finally, to find the sum of only the proper divisors, I'll subtract 36 from this total: \(91 - 36 = 55\).
</think>

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of 36, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Prime Factorization of 36:**
   
   \(36 = 2^2 \times 3^2\)

2. **Use the Formula for the Sum of Divisors:**
   
   The sum of all divisors (including the number itself) of a number \(n = p_1^{k_1} \times p_2^{k_2} \times \dots \times p_m^{k_m}\) is given by:
   
   \[
   \sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{k_1}) \times (1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_2^{k_2}) \times \dots \times (1 + p_m + p_m^2 + \dots + p_m^{k_m})
   \]
   
   Applying this to 36:
   
   - For the prime factor 2 with exponent 2:
     
     \[
     1 + 2 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
     \]
     
   - For the prime factor 3 with exponent 2:
     
     \[
     1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13
     \]
     
   - Multiply these results together to get the sum of all divisors:
     
     \[
     \sigma(36) = 7 \times 13 = 91
     \]

3. **Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors:**
   
   Proper divisors are all divisors of \(n\) excluding \(n\) itself. Therefore, subtract 36 from the total sum of divisors:
   
   \[
   \text{Sum of proper divisors} = \sigma(36) - 36 = 91 - 36 = 55
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{55}
   \]
