<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36.

First, I'll list all the divisors of 36. Starting from 1, I'll check which numbers divide 36 without leaving a remainder. The divisors I find are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

Next, I'll exclude the number itself (36) from the list of divisors to get the proper divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Finally, I'll sum these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 equals 45.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Determine the Proper Divisors of 36**

A proper divisor of a number is a divisor other than the number itself. Let's list all divisors of 36 and then exclude 36 to find the proper divisors.

1. **Divisors of 36:**
   - Start with 1 (since 1 divides every number).
   - Check 2: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) → 2 is a divisor.
   - Check 3: \(36 \div 3 = 12\) → 3 is a divisor.
   - Check 4: \(36 \div 4 = 9\) → 4 is a divisor.
   - Check 5: \(36 \div 5 = 7.2\) → Not a whole number, so 5 is not a divisor.
   - Check 6: \(36 \div 6 = 6\) → 6 is a divisor.
   - Continue this process until all possibilities are covered.

   By this method, the complete list of **divisors** of 36 is:
   \[
   1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 6,\ 9,\ 12,\ 18,\ 36
   \]

2. **Exclude the number itself to get proper divisors:**
   \[
   \text{Proper Divisors of }36 = 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 6,\ 9,\ 12,\ 18
   \]

### **Step 2: Sum the Proper Divisors**

Now, add all the proper divisors together:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 45
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{45}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To determine the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by identifying all of its divisors.

First, I'll list the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder. These are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

Next, I'll exclude 36 itself since we're only interested in proper divisors.

Now, I'll sum up the remaining numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18. Adding these together gives a total of 55.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify All Divisors of 36
A proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

Let's list all divisors of **36**:
- **1** (since 36 ÷ 1 = 36)
- **2** (36 ÷ 2 = 18)
- **3** (36 ÷ 3 = 12)
- **4** (36 ÷ 4 = 9)
- **6** (36 ÷ 6 = 6)
- **9** (36 ÷ 9 = 4)
- **12** (36 ÷ 12 = 3)
- **18** (36 ÷ 18 = 2)
- **36** (36 ÷ 36 = 1)

### Step 2: Exclude the Number Itself
Since we're only interested in **proper divisors**, we exclude **36**.

### Step 3: Sum the Proper Divisors
Now, add up all the proper divisors:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{55}
\]
