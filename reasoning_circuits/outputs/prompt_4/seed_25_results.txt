<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by listing all the numbers that divide 36 evenly without leaving a remainder. These are the proper divisors.

First, the number 1 is always a proper divisor of any number.

Next, I'll find the divisors of 36 by checking each number sequentially. I determine that 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 are the proper divisors.

Finally, I'll add these divisors together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9, which equals 25. So, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 25.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **List all proper divisors of 36:**
   
   A proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number exactly without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.
   
   Let's list them:
   
   \[
   1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9
   \]
   
2. **Sum the proper divisors:**
   
   Add all the proper divisors together:
   
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 = 25
   \]
   
3. **Final Answer:**
   
   The sum of all proper divisors of **36** is:
   
   \[
   \boxed{25}
   \]

To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by listing all the numbers that divide 36 evenly without leaving a remainder. These are the proper divisors.

First, I'll identify the prime factors of 36. Breaking it down, 36 can be expressed as \(6 \times 6\), and further, \(6\) is \(2 \times 3\). So, the prime factorization of 36 is \(2^2 \times 3^2\).

Using the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \((1 + p + p^2 + \dots + p^n)\) for each prime factor \(p\) raised to the power of \(n\), I can calculate the sum of all divisors. For \(2^2\), the sum is \(1 + 2 + 4\), and for \(3^2\), it's \(1 + 3 + 9\).

Multiplying these sums together gives the total sum of all divisors: \((1 + 2 + 4) \times (1 + 3 + 9) = 7 \times 13 = 91\).

Finally, to find the sum of just the proper divisors, I subtract 36 from this total: \(91 - 36 = 55\).

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand Proper Divisors
A **proper divisor** of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 36 are all the numbers that divide 36 evenly, excluding 36.

### Step 2: List All Proper Divisors of 36
Let's list the divisors of 36 and exclude 36 itself:
- 1 (since 1 divides every number)
- 2 (36 ÷ 2 = 18)
- 3 (36 ÷ 3 = 12)
- 4 (36 ÷ 4 = 9)
- 6 (36 ÷ 6 = 6)
- 9 (36 ÷ 9 = 4)
- 12 (36 ÷ 12 = 3)
- 18 (36 ÷ 18 = 2)

**List of Proper Divisors:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18

### Step 3: Sum the Proper Divisors
Now, add all these proper divisors together:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
\]

Calculating step by step:
\[
1 + 2 = 3 \\
3 + 3 = 6 \\
6 + 4 = 10 \\
10 + 6 = 16 \\
16 + 9 = 25 \\
25 + 12 = 37 \\
37 + 18 = 55
\]

**Sum of Proper Divisors:** \(\boxed{55}\)
