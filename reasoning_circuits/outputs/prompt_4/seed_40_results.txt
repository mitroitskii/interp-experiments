Input message: What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?

--- Sampling (temp=1.0) ---
<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the divisors of the number 36. Starting with 1 and 36 themselves, I list the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder. These include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 36.

Next, I'll determine which of these divisors are proper. Proper divisors are all divisors of a number excluding the number itself. This means I remove 36 from the list, leaving me with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12.

Now, I'll add all these proper divisors together to find their sum. Adding 1 and 2 gives me 3. Adding 3 to that makes it 6. Continuing this process: 6 plus 4 equals 10, 10 plus 6 equals 16, 16 plus 9 equals 25, and finally, 25 plus 12 gives me a total of 37.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 37.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify All Divisors of 36
A **divisor** of a number is an integer that can be multiplied by another integer to result in that number. Let's list all divisors of 36:

\[
1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12, \ 18, \ 36
\]

### Step 2: Determine Proper Divisors
A **proper divisor** of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. Therefore, we exclude **36** from the list:

\[
1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12, \ 18
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Now, add all the proper divisors together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer
The sum of all proper divisors of **36** is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the divisors of 36. Starting with 1, since 1 is a divisor of every number. Next, I'll check the numbers up to the square root of 36, which is 6. The divisors I find are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 36.

Now, I'll list all the proper divisors, which means excluding the number itself. So, the proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.

Finally, to find the sum of these proper divisors, I'll add them together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6, which equals 16.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proper Divisors of 36

A **proper divisor** of a number is a positive integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

Let's list all the divisors of 36:

- **1** (since 1 divides every number)
- **2** (because 36 ÷ 2 = 18)
- **3** (because 36 ÷ 3 = 12)
- **4** (because 36 ÷ 4 = 9)
- **6** (because 36 ÷ 6 = 6)
- **9** (because 36 ÷ 9 = 4)
- **12** (because 36 ÷ 12 = 3)
- **18** (because 36 ÷ 18 = 2)
- **36** (the number itself, which we exclude)

**Proper Divisors of 36:**  
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of the Proper Divisors

Now, add up all the proper divisors:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
\]

Let's compute this step by step:

\[
1 + 2 = 3 \\
3 + 3 = 6 \\
6 + 4 = 10 \\
10 + 6 = 16 \\
16 + 9 = 25 \\
25 + 12 = 37 \\
37 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer

The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]
