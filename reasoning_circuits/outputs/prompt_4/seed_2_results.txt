<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, okay. First off, what exactly are proper divisors? From what I remember, proper divisors of a number are all the positive integers that divide that number evenly, excluding the number itself. So, for 36, I need to list out all the numbers that divide it without leaving a remainder, except 36.

Alright, let's start by figuring out what the proper divisors of 36 are. I think the best way is to list them systematically. Maybe starting from 1 and going up until half of 36.

Starting with 1. Well, 1 divides every number, so that's definitely a proper divisor.

Next, 2. Does 2 divide 36 evenly? Yes, because 36 divided by 2 is 18, which is an integer. So, 2 is a proper divisor.

3. Hmm, 3 times 12 is 36, so yes, 3 is also a proper divisor.

4. 4 times 9 is 36. Okay, 4 is a proper divisor.

5. 5 doesn't divide into 36 evenly, right? 5 times 7 is 35, and 5 times 8 is 40, so it doesn't divide 36. So, 5 isn't a divisor.

6. 6 times 6 is 36. Yes, so 6 is a proper divisor.

Wait, hold on, 6 squared is 36, so 6 is a divisor. Also, 7? Let me see, 7 times 5 is 35, 7 times 6 is 42, so no, 7 doesn't divide 36.

8. 8 times 4.5 is 36, but we only consider integers, so 8 doesn't divide 36.

9. 9 is 36 divided by 4, which is 9, so 9 is a proper divisor.

10. 10 times 3.6 is 36, which isn't an integer. So, 10 isn't a divisor.

11. 11 times something is 36? 11 times 3 is 33, 11 times 4 is 44, so no, 11 doesn't divide.

12. 12 times 3 is 36. So, 12 is a proper divisor.

Wait, but if I go beyond 12, that's actually more than half of 36, which is 18. Since we're listing proper divisors, they should be less than 36. But after 12, the next number would be 18, but 18 is half of 36. Wait, is 18 considered a proper divisor or not? Hmm, the definition I know is that proper divisors exclude the number itself, so 18 would be a proper divisor because it's not equal to 36, right?

Wait, hold on, is 18 less than 36? Yes, so 18 is a proper divisor. Hmm, so maybe I stopped too early earlier.

Let me rethink. A proper divisor is any divisor other than the number itself. So, starting from 1, and going up to 35, listing all divisors except 36. But that's a lot. Instead, maybe it's better to find all pairs of divisors that multiply to 36.

So, since 1 times 36 is 36, but 36 is not a proper divisor. Then, 2 times 18 is 36, so 2 and 18 are proper divisors.

3 times 12 is 36, so 3 and 12 are proper.

4 times 9 is 36, so 4 and 9 are proper.

6 times 6 is 36, so 6 is repeated, but it's only counted once.

So, compiling these, the proper divisors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Let me double-check if I missed any.

Starting from 1: 1 x 36.

2: 2 x 18.

3: 3 x 12.

4: 4 x 9.

6: 6 x 6.

Yes, that's all. So, the proper divisors are indeed 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now, I need to calculate the sum of these numbers.

Let me list them out:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Adding them one by one.

Starting from 1.

1 + 2 = 3.

3 + 3 = 6.

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, okay. First, let me make sure I understand what a proper divisor is. If I recall correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 36 would be all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36. That makes sense.

So, to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I need to list out all the numbers that divide 36 and then add them up, excluding 36 itself. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a quicker way to do this without having to list them all out. Wait, I think there's something called the "sum of divisors function" which gives the sum of all divisors of a number, including the number itself. If that's the case, then maybe I can use that function and then subtract the number itself to get the sum of the proper divisors. Yeah, that sounds efficient.

Let me recall how the sum of divisors function works. If a number is expressed in its prime factorization form, say \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \dots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the sum of the divisors of n is given by the product of the sums of each prime power from 0 up to their exponent. So, in mathematical terms, it would be \( (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{a_1}) \times (1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_2^{a_2}) \times \dots \times (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \dots + p_k^{a_k}) \).

Okay, so first, I need to factorize 36 into its prime factors. Let me do that. 36 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 36 by 2 gives me 18. 18 is also even, so dividing by 2 again gives me 9. Now, 9 is not even, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. Dividing 9 by 3 gives me 3, and dividing 3 by 3 gives me 1. So, the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3. In exponential form, that's \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \).

Great, so now I can apply the sum of divisors formula. For the prime factor 2 with exponent 2, the sum of its powers from 0 to 2 is \( 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \). For the prime factor 3 with exponent 2, the sum is \( 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \). So, multiplying these two sums together gives me the total sum of all divisors of 36, including 36 itself. That would be \( 7 \times 13 = 91 \).

But wait, the question asks for the sum of all proper divisors, not including 36. So, I need to subtract 36 from this total. Let me do that: 91 minus 36 equals 55. Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 should be 55.

Just to double-check, maybe I should list all the proper divisors of 36 and add them up to make sure I get 55. Let's see. The proper divisors of 36 are the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself. Starting from 1:

1 is a divisor of every number, so that's 1.

36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 and 18 are divisors. Wait, but since we're only listing proper divisors, 18 is a proper divisor.

36 divided by 3 is 12, so 3 and 12 are proper divisors.

36 divided by 4 is 9, so 4 and 9 are proper divisors.

36 divided by 6 is 6, so 6 is a proper divisor, but since it's the square root, I think it's only counted once.

Wait, hold on. Let me list them systematically. Starting from 1 and moving up:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Is that all? Let me check. 36 divided by 5 is 7
