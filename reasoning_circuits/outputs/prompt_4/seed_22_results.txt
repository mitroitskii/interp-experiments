<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors are all the divisors of a number except the number itself. First, I'll list all the divisors of 36.

Starting with 1, since 1 divides every number. Then, I'll check the next numbers sequentially. 2 divides 36 because it's even, 3 divides 36 since the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. 4 divides 36 because 36 divided by 4 is 9, which is an integer. 6 divides 36 because it is half of 12, which in turn divides evenly into 36. Finally, 9 and 12 are also divisors, and 18 and 36. However, I should exclude 36 itself as it is the number being evaluated.

So, the proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Next, I'll add these numbers together. Starting with 1 and 2, that gives me 3. Adding 3 makes it 6, then 4 brings the total to 10. Adding 6 gives me 16, followed by 9, which totals 25. Adding 12, I get 37, and finally, adding 18 results in a final sum of 55.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of 36, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify Proper Divisors
A **proper divisor** of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. For 36, the proper divisors are:

\[
1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12, \ 18
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum
Now, add all the proper divisors together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
\]

Let's perform the addition step by step:

\[
\begin{align*}
1 + 2 &= 3 \\
3 + 3 &= 6 \\
6 + 4 &= 10 \\
10 + 6 &= 16 \\
16 + 9 &= 25 \\
25 + 12 &= 37 \\
37 + 18 &= 55 \\
\end{align*}
\]

### Final Answer

The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors are numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself. Starting from 1, I'll check each number to see if it divides 36 evenly.

1 divides 36, so 1 is a proper divisor. Next, 2 divides 36, so 2 is also a proper divisor. Checking 3, it divides 36 evenly as well, so 3 is included. Moving on, 4 divides 36, making 4 another proper divisor. Then, 6 divides 36, so 6 is added to the list. Finally, 9 divides 36, and 12 also divides 36 without any remainder. 

Now, I have all the proper divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12. To find the sum of these divisors, I'll add them together step by step. Starting with 1 and 2, the sum is 3. Adding 3 gives 6, then adding 4 brings the total to 10. Next, adding 6 results in 16. Adding 9 gives 25, and finally, adding 12 completes the sum, which is 37.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors of 36**, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proper Divisors of 36:**
   
   Proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For 36, the proper divisors are:
   \[
   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12
   \]

2. **Calculate the Sum of These Divisors:**
   
   Add all the proper divisors together:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12
   \]
   
   Let's compute step by step:
   \[
   1 + 2 = 3
   \]
   \[
   3 + 3 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 + 4 = 10
   \]
   \[
   10 + 6 = 16
   \]
   \[
   16 + 9 = 25
   \]
   \[
   25 + 12 = 37
   \]
   
3. **Final Answer:**
   
   The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:
   \[
   \boxed{37}
   \]
