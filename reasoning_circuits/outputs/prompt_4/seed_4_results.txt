<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I identify the number 36 and list its total divisors. Divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

Next, I need to determine the proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors exclude the number itself, so they are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Then, I calculate the sum of these proper divisors. Adding them together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 equals 55.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the divisors of 36**:
   - 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36

2. **Exclude the number itself** (36 is not a proper divisor):
   - Proper divisors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18

3. **Sum the proper divisors**:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{55}

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the divisors of 36. I'll start by listing the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder.

Next, I'll determine which of these divisors are proper, meaning they are less than 36.

After listing all the proper divisors, I'll add them together to find their sum.
</think>

To find the sum of all proper divisors of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **List all divisors of 36:**
   
   - **1** (since 1 × 36 = 36)
   - **2** (since 2 × 18 = 36)
   - **3** (since 3 × 12 = 36)
   - **4** (since 4 × 9 = 36)
   - **6** (since 6 × 6 = 36)
   - **9** (since 9 × 4 = 36)
   - **12** (since 12 × 3 = 36)
   - **18** (since 18 × 2 = 36)
   - **36** (since 36 × 1 = 36)

2. **Identify the proper divisors (excluding 36 itself):**
   
   Proper divisors of 36 are:
   \[
   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the sum of these proper divisors:**
   
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{55}
\]
