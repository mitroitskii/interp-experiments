<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by identifying all the divisors of the number.

First, I'll list the divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

Next, I need to determine which of these are proper divisors. Proper divisors are all positive integers that divide the number evenly without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

So, the proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Finally, I'll sum these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18.

Adding them together gives a total sum of 55.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of the number \( 36 \), follow these steps:

1. **List all divisors of 36:**
   - 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36

2. **Identify the proper divisors:**
   - Proper divisors are all positive divisors excluding the number itself.
   - Therefore, the proper divisors of 36 are: 
     - \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 \)

3. **Calculate the sum of the proper divisors:**
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{55}
\]

To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by identifying all the divisors of 36. Divisors are numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder. 

First, I'll list the numbers from 1 to 36 and check which ones divide 36 evenly. The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

Next, I need to determine which of these are proper divisors. Proper divisors exclude the number itself, so I'll exclude 36 from the list. The proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Finally, I'll add these proper divisors together to find their sum. Adding them step by step:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

So, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proper Divisors of 36

A proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

Let's list all the divisors of 36:

- **1** (since 36 ÷ 1 = 36)
- **2** (36 ÷ 2 = 18)
- **3** (36 ÷ 3 = 12)
- **4** (36 ÷ 4 = 9)
- **6** (36 ÷ 6 = 6)
- **9** (36 ÷ 9 = 4)
- **12** (36 ÷ 12 = 3)
- **18** (36 ÷ 18 = 2)
- **36** (36 ÷ 36 = 1)

**Proper Divisors of 36:**  
\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18\)

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors

Now, add all the proper divisors together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer

The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]
