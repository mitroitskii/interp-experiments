<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the proper divisors of 36, which are all the positive integers that divide 36 exactly, excluding 36 itself.

I'll start by identifying the prime factors of 36. Since 36 can be divided by 2, I get 2 as a prime factor. Dividing 18 by 2 gives another 2, so I have 2² as part of the prime factorization. Next, I divide 9 by 3 to find that 3 is another prime factor, and since 9 divided by 3 equals 3, I have 3².

With the prime factorization of 36 being \(2^2 \times 3^2\), I can list all the possible combinations of these prime factors to find all divisors. 

Calculating the divisors:
- \(2^0 \times 3^0 = 1\)
- \(2^1 \times 3^0 = 2\)
- \(2^2 \times 3^0 = 4\)
- \(2^0 \times 3^1 = 3\)
- \(2^1 \times 3^1 = 6\)
- \(2^2 \times 3^1 = 12\)
- \(2^0 \times 3^2 = 9\)
- \(2^1 \times 3^2 = 18\)
- \(2^2 \times 3^2 = 36\)

The proper divisors of 36 are all the divisors except 36 itself: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Finally, I'll add these proper divisors together:
\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55\)
</think>

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand Proper Divisors
A **proper divisor** of a number is a positive integer that divides that number exactly, excluding the number itself.

### Step 2: List All Proper Divisors of 36
First, identify all divisors of 36:

- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 6
- 9
- 12
- 18
- 36 (but we exclude this since it's the number itself)

**Proper Divisors of 36:**  
\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18\)

### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Add all the proper divisors together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
\]

\[
= (1 + 2) + (3 + 4) + (6 + 9) + (12 + 18)
\]

\[
= 3 + 7 + 15 + 30
\]

\[
= 3 + 7 = 10
\]
\[
10 + 15 = 25
\]
\[
25 + 30 = 55
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{55}
\]

First, I need to identify all the proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors are the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

I'll start by listing the numbers that multiply together to give 36. The prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3.

Using the prime factors, I can determine all the divisors by considering different combinations of these factors. This gives me the divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Next, I'll add up all these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18. This totals 55.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proper Divisors of 36
Proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself.

1. **List the divisors of 36:**
   - Start by finding the prime factors of 36.
   - Prime factors of 36: \( 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \)
   - Now, determine all divisors by combining these prime factors:
     - \( 1 \)
     - \( 2 \)
     - \( 3 \)
     - \( 4 \) (since \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \))
     - \( 6 \) (since \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \))
     - \( 9 \) (since \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \))
     - \( 12 \) (since \( 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12 \))
     - \( 18 \) (since \( 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 18 \))
     - \( 36 \) (the number itself, which we exclude)
   
2. **List of Proper Divisors:**
   \[
   1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 6,\ 9,\ 12,\ 18
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Add all the proper divisors together:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{55}
\]
