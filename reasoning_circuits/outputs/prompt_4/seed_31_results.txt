<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I identify that 36 is the number in question.

Next, I list all of its divisors by determining which numbers divide evenly into 36 without leaving a remainder.

The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Now, I exclude the number itself, 36, from the list of divisors to find only the proper divisors.

The proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Finally, I calculate the sum of these proper divisors by adding them together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18.

The sum is 63.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand Proper Divisors
- **Proper divisors** of a number are the divisors excluding the number itself.
- For **36**, the proper divisors are the numbers that divide **36** without leaving a remainder, except **36**.

### Step 2: List All Divisors of 36
Let's list all divisors of **36**:
- **1** (because \(36 \div 1 = 36\))
- **2** (because \(36 \div 2 = 18\))
- **3** (because \(36 \div 3 = 12\))
- **4** (because \(36 \div 4 = 9\))
- **6** (because \(36 \div 6 = 6\))
- **9** (because \(36 \div 9 = 4\))
- **12** (because \(36 \div 12 = 3\))
- **18** (because \(36 \div 18 = 2\))
- **36** (because \(36 \div 36 = 1\))

### Step 3: Exclude the Number Itself
Since we're only considering proper divisors, we exclude **36**.

### Step 4: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Now, add all the proper divisors:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 63
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{63}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors are numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

I'll start by listing the numbers that multiply together to give 36. The prime factors of 36 are 2, 3, and 3.

Next, I'll consider all possible combinations of these prime factors to find all the divisors:
- 1 (the multiplicative identity)
- 2
- 3
- 4 (2 squared)
- 6 (2 multiplied by 3)
- 9 (3 squared)
- 12 (2 squared multiplied by 3)
- 18 (2 multiplied by 3 squared)
- 36 (2 squared multiplied by 3 squared) – this is excluded as it's the number itself.

The proper divisors of 36 are therefore 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Finally, I'll add these proper divisors together to find their sum:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proper Divisors of 36

A **proper divisor** of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. Let's list all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

1. **Prime Factorization of 36**:
   \[
   36 = 2^2 \times 3^2
   \]
   
2. **Find All Divisors**:
   The divisors of 36 can be found by combining the prime factors in all possible ways:
   \[
   1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 6,\ 9,\ 12,\ 18,\ 36
   \]
   
3. **Exclude the Number Itself**:
   Proper divisors of 36 are:
   \[
   1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 6,\ 9,\ 12,\ 18
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors

Now, add all the proper divisors together:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer

\[
\boxed{55}
\]
