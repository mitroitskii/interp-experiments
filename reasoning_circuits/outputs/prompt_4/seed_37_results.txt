<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by identifying the proper divisors. Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number excluding the number itself. So for 36, the proper divisors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

Next, I'll add these divisors together: 1 plus 2 equals 3, then plus 3 equals 6, plus 4 equals 10, plus 6 equals 16, and finally plus 9 equals 25. Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 25.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, let's follow these steps:

1. **List the proper divisors of 36:**
   Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number except the number itself. For 36, the proper divisors are:
   \[
   1, \, 2, \, 3, \, 4, \, 6, \, 9
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of these divisors:**
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 = 25
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{25}
   \]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by identifying the proper divisors. Proper divisors are all positive integers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

First, I'll list the divisors of 36. Starting from 1, I'll check which numbers divide 36 evenly. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 36.

Next, I'll exclude 36 from the list of divisors since we're only considering proper divisors. This leaves me with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12.

Finally, I'll add these proper divisors together to find their sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 equals 37.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proper Divisors
A **proper divisor** of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.

- **Divisors of 36**: 
  \[
  1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12, \ 36
  \]
  
- **Proper Divisors of 36** (excluding 36):
  \[
  1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Add all the proper divisors together:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 37
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{37}
\]
