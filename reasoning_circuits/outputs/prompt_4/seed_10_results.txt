<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine all the proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors are the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

I'll start by identifying the prime factors of 36. The prime factorization of 36 is 2 squared multiplied by 3 squared.

Using the formula for the sum of divisors, the sum of all divisors, including the number itself, is (2 + 1) multiplied by (2 + 1) which equals 9.

Finally, I'll subtract 36 from the total sum of divisors to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. This gives me 9 minus 36, which equals -27.

However, since the question asks for the sum of proper divisors, and this result is negative, I realize that there might be an error in my approach. Upon revisiting the calculation, I correct the sum of divisors to be 9, and since I properly excluded 36, the correct sum of proper divisors should be 9.

Wait, let me double-check. The proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18. Adding these together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 equals 55. So the correct sum should be 55.

Actually, the initial formula gave me 9, which was incorrect. I must have misunderstood the formula. The correct formula for the sum of divisors of \( n = p^a \times q^b \) is \( (1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^a)(1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^b) \). For 36, which is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \), the sum of divisors is \( (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 3 + 9) \), which equals 7 times 13, totaling 91. Subtracting 36 gives me 55, which matches the manual addition. So, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Identify the Proper Divisors of 36**

Proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For 36, the proper divisors are:

\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 \]

### **Step 2: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors**

Now, add all these proper divisors together:

\[
\begin{align*}
1 + 2 &= 3 \\
3 + 3 &= 6 \\
6 + 4 &= 10 \\
10 + 6 &= 16 \\
16 + 9 &= 25 \\
25 + 12 &= 37 \\
37 + 18 &= 55 \\
\end{align*}
\]

So, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]

To determine the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I will start by identifying its prime factors. 

36 can be factored into 2 squared multiplied by 3 squared, which is written as 2² × 3².

Using the formula for the sum of divisors, if a number is expressed as p^a × q^b, the sum of all its divisors is (1 + p + p² + ... + p^a) × (1 + q + q² + ... + q^b).

For 36, this becomes (1 + 2 + 4) × (1 + 3 + 9), which equals 7 × 13, and that's 91.

However, the problem asks for the sum of proper divisors, which excludes the number itself. So, I'll subtract 36 from 91, resulting in 55.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand Proper Divisors
A **proper divisor** of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of **36** are all the numbers that divide **36** evenly, excluding **36** itself.

### Step 2: List the Proper Divisors of 36
Let's list all the numbers that divide **36** evenly:
- **1** (since 1 × 36 = 36)
- **2** (since 2 × 18 = 36)
- **3** (since 3 × 12 = 36)
- **4** (since 4 × 9 = 36)
- **6** (since 6 × 6 = 36)
- **9** (since 9 × 4 = 36)
- **12** (since 12 × 3 = 36)
- **18** (since 18 × 2 = 36)

So, the proper divisors of **36** are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors
Now, add all these proper divisors together:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
\]

### Final Answer
The sum of all proper divisors of **36** is:
\[
\boxed{55}
\]
