<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To determine the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by identifying its proper divisors. These are the numbers that divide 36 evenly without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself. 

So, the proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Next, I'll add these divisors together. 

Adding them sequentially: 1 plus 2 equals 3, plus 3 equals 6, plus 4 equals 10, plus 6 equals 16, and finally, plus 9 gives a total sum of 25. 

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 25.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of all proper divisors of a number, we first need to identify all of its divisors and then sum them up, excluding the number itself.

Let's do this step by step for the number **36**.

1. **Find the proper divisors of 36:**
   
   Proper divisors of a number are the numbers that divide it evenly, excluding the number itself.
   
   - Start with 1: \(1 \times 36 = 36\), so 1 is a divisor.
   - Then, check if 2 divides 36: \(2 \times 18 = 36\), so 2 is a divisor.
   - Next, 3: \(3 \times 12 = 36\), so 3 is a divisor.
   - Continue this process:
     - 4: \(4 \times 9 = 36\) → 4
     - 6: \(6 \times 6 = 36\) → 6
     - 9: \(9 \times 4 = 36\) → 9
     - 12: \(12 \times 3 = 36\) → 12
     - 18: \(18 \times 2 = 36\) → 18
     - 36: Excluded because it's the number itself.
   
   So, the proper divisors of 36 are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18**.

2. **Sum the proper divisors:**
   
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
   \]
   
   Let's add them sequentially:
   
   \[
   1 + 2 = 3 \\
   3 + 3 = 6 \\
   6 + 4 = 10 \\
   10 + 6 = 16 \\
   16 + 9 = 25 \\
   25 + 12 = 37 \\
   37 + 18 = 55
   \]
   
   So, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is **55**.

\[
\boxed{55}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To determine the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by identifying its proper divisors. Proper divisors are numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

First, I'll list the numbers that divide evenly into 36:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Next, I'll add these divisors together:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18.

Calculating the sum step by step:
1 + 2 = 3,
3 + 3 = 6,
6 + 4 = 10,
10 + 6 = 16,
16 + 9 = 25,
25 + 12 = 37,
37 + 18 = 55.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proper Divisors of 36:**
   
   Proper divisors are numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

   \[
   1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12, \ 18
   \]

2. **Calculate the Sum of These Divisors:**

   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
   \]

3. **Add the Numbers Step by Step:**

   \[
   1 + 2 = 3
   \]
   
   \[
   3 + 3 = 6
   \]
   
   \[
   6 + 4 = 10
   \]
   
   \[
   10 + 6 = 16
   \]
   
   \[
   16 + 9 = 25
   \]
   
   \[
   25 + 12 = 37
   \]
   
   \[
   37 + 18 = 55
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**

   The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:

   \[
   \boxed{55}
   \]
