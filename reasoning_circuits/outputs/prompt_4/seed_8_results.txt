<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to figure out the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me recall what a proper divisor is. If I remember correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself. So, for 36, I'm looking for all numbers less than 36 that can divide it evenly, and then adding those up.

Okay, let me start by listing all the divisors of 36. To do this, maybe I can factorize 36 first, because prime factorization might make it easier to find all the divisors. The prime factors of 36 are 2, 3, and 2 squared times 3 squared. Wait, let me see: 36 divided by 2 is 18, 18 divided by 2 is 9, 9 divided by 3 is 3, and 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, that's 2 squared times 3 squared, right? So, 36 is \(2^2 \times 3^2\).

Now, to find all the divisors, I can use the exponents of the prime factors. The formula for finding the number of divisors is to add one to each of the exponents and multiply them. So, for 36, that would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 divisors in total. But actually, I think I should just list them out.

Starting from 1, since 1 is a divisor of every number. Then, 2 divides 36, right? 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 is a divisor. Next, 3: 36 divided by 3 is 12, so 3 is a divisor. 4: 36 divided by 4 is 9, which is a whole number, so 4 is also a divisor. 5 doesn't divide 36 because 36 divided by 5 is 7.2, which isn't an integer. 6: 36 divided by 6 is 6, so 6 is a divisor. 7 doesn't divide 36 because 36 divided by 7 is about 5.14, which isn't a whole number. 8: 36 divided by 8 is 4.5, so that's not a divisor. 9: 36 divided by 9 is 4, so 9 is a divisor. 10: 36 divided by 10 is 3.6, which isn't an integer. 11: Doesn't divide, 36 divided by 11 is roughly 3.27. 12: 36 divided by 12 is 3, so 12 is a divisor. 13: Doesn't divide. 14: 36 divided by 14 is about 2.57, not an integer. 15: 36 divided by 15 is 2.4, so no. 16: 36 divided by 16 is 2.25, which isn't a whole number. 17: Doesn't divide. 18: 36 divided by 18 is 2, so 18 is a divisor. 19: Doesn't divide. 20: 36 divided by 20 is 1.8, not integer. 21: Doesn't divide. 22: Doesn't divide. 23: Nope. 24: 36 divided by 24 is 1.5, so no. 25: Doesn't divide. 26: 36 divided by 26 is about 1.38, no. 27: 36 divided by 27 is about 1.33, not a whole number. 28: 36 divided by 28 is roughly 1.29, nope. 29: Doesn't divide. 30: 36 divided by 30 is 1.2, nope. 31: Doesn't divide. 32: 36 divided by 32 is about 1.125, so no. 33: Doesn't divide. 34: 36 divided by 34 is roughly 1.05, no. 35: Doesn't divide. 36: Well, that's the number itself, which we aren't supposed to include since we're only counting proper divisors.

So, listing out all the proper divisors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. Wait, hold on, didn't I miss some? Let me double-check.

After 1, we have 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. Is that all? Because 36 is 2

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the proper divisors of 36. Proper divisors are numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

Starting from 1, since 1 divides every number. Next, 2 divides 36 evenly. 3 is also a divisor because 36 divided by 3 is 12. Moving on, 4 divides 36 as 36 divided by 4 is 9. 6 is a divisor because 36 divided by 6 is 6. 9 divides 36 as well, giving 4. Finally, 12 divides 36, yielding 3.

Listing them out, the proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12.

Next, I will sum these proper divisors. Adding them step by step: 1 plus 2 equals 3, plus 3 equals 6, plus 4 equals 10, plus 6 equals 16, plus 9 equals 25, and finally, plus 12 equals 37.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 37.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of **36**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proper Divisors of 36
Proper divisors of a number are the divisors excluding the number itself. Let's list all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder:

- **1** (since 1 divides every number)
- **2** (36 ÷ 2 = 18)
- **3** (36 ÷ 3 = 12)
- **4** (36 ÷ 4 = 9)
- **6** (36 ÷ 6 = 6)
- **9** (36 ÷ 9 = 4)
- **12** (36 ÷ 12 = 3)

So, the proper divisors of 36 are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12**

### Step 2: Sum the Proper Divisors
Now, add these proper divisors together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 37
\]

### Final Answer
The sum of all proper divisors of **36** is:

\[
\boxed{37}
\]
