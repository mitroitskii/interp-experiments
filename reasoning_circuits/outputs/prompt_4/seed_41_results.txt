<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me first recall what proper divisors are. If I remember correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a divisor of that number excluding the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 6 would be 1, 2, and 3, and their sum would be 6. That makes me think about the concept of perfect numbers, but I don't know if 36 is a perfect number or not. Maybe I'll get to that later.

First, let me list out all the divisors of 36, including the number itself, and then I can exclude 36 to get the proper divisors. Okay, starting from the smallest number, 1, that divides every number, right? So 1 is definitely a divisor of 36.

Next, 2. Since 36 is an even number, it's divisible by 2. 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 and 18 are both divisors. Now, moving on to 3. Adding the digits of 36: 3 + 6 = 9, which is divisible by 3, so yes, 3 is a divisor. 36 divided by 3 is 12, so 3 and 12 are both divisors.

Now, 4. 36 divided by 4 is 9, which is an integer, so 4 and 9 are divisors. Wait, 9 is a square number, so 9 is 3 squared. Let me remember that 36 is a perfect square since 6 times 6 is 36. So, sqrt(36) is 6, which is a divisor. So, 6 is included.

So, 6 divides 36 as 36 divided by 6 is 6. Let me see, is there another number between 6 and 9? Let's see, 7: does 7 divide 36? 7 times 5 is 35, which is close, but 7 doesn't divide evenly into 36. 36 divided by 7 is approximately 5.14, which is not an integer. So, 7 is not a divisor.

What about 8? 8 times 4 is 32, and 8 times 5 is 40, which is beyond 36, so 8 doesn't divide into 36. 8 divided into 36 is 4.5, which is not an integer. So, 8 is out.

Next, 9: as I already mentioned, 9 is a divisor, and we covered that.

Moving beyond 9, since 10: 36 divided by 10 is 3.6, which isn't an integer. So, 10 doesn't divide 36. 11: 36 divided by 11 is approximately 3.27, not an integer. So, 11 is not a divisor. 12: we already have that as a divisor because 3 times 12 is 36.

Moving on, 13, 14: doesn't divide into 36 since 13 and 14 are both beyond the square root of 36. So, I think we've covered all the possible divisors by checking numbers up to 6, which is the square root.

Wait, no, actually, that might not be thorough. Let me list all the divisors again more carefully. So, starting from 1, then 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. So, the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

Okay, so proper divisors would be all of these except 36. So, that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. Now, I need to sum these numbers. Let me write them down and add them step by step:

1 + 2 = 3.

3 + 3 = 6.

6 + 4 = 10.

10 + 6 = 16.

16 + 9 = 25.

25 + 12 = 37.

37 + 18 = 55.

So, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 55. Wait a second, is that correct? Let me verify.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of divisors. There's a function in number theory called the sum-of-divisors function, σ(n), which adds up all the divisors of a number n. If I can compute σ(36) and then subtract 36 to get the sum of proper

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me think about what proper divisors are. If I remember correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 36 would be all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except 36. That means I need to list out all the numbers that can multiply together in pairs to give 36 and then add them up, excluding 36 itself.

Alright, let me start by finding all the divisors of 36. I can do this by finding the prime factorization of 36 first, and then using that to list out all possible divisors.

So, prime factorization of 36. I know that 36 is 6 times 6, and 6 is 2 times 3. So, breaking it down, 36 is 2 squared times 3 squared. That is, 36 = 2² × 3².

Now, to find all the divisors, I can use the exponents of the prime factors. The formula for the number of divisors is (exponent of 2 + 1) times (exponent of 3 + 1). So, that would be (2 + 1) × (2 + 1) = 3 × 3 = 9 divisors in total. Let me list them out.

Starting from 1, since 1 is a divisor of every number. Then, since 2 is a prime factor, 2 and 3 are also divisors. Next, 2 squared is 4, and 3 squared is 9. Then, 2 times 3 is 6, and 2 times 3 squared is 18, and 3 times 2 squared is 12. Finally, 2 squared times 3 squared is 36. So, listing them all out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

Now, proper divisors are all divisors except the number itself, which is 36. So, removing 36 from the list, the proper divisors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now, I need to add these up. Let me do that step by step to avoid mistakes.

Starting with 1, then adding 2 gives 3. Then, adding 3 gives 6. Adding 4 brings it to 10. Adding 6 gives 16. Adding 9 gives 25. Adding 12 brings it to 37. Adding 18 gives 55.

Wait, let me check that addition again because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18. Maybe grouping them differently will help.

Let me add the smaller ones first: 1 + 2 is 3, 3 + 3 is 6, 6 + 4 is 10, 10 + 6 is 16, 16 + 9 is 25, 25 + 12 is 37, and 37 + 18 is 55.

Hmm, same result. So, is the sum of proper divisors of 36 equal to 55?

Wait a second, I remember there's a formula for the sum of divisors based on the prime factorization. Maybe I can use that to verify my result.

The formula is: For a number n = p₁^a × p₂^b × ... × pₙ^k, the sum of divisors is (1 + p₁ + p₁² + ... + p₁^a) × (1 + p₂ + p₂² + ... + p₂^b) × ... × (1 + pₙ + pₙ² + ... + pₙ^k).

Since the sum of all divisors includes the number itself, and I need the sum of proper divisors, I can subtract the number from the total sum.

So, let's apply this formula to 36. The prime factors are 2² × 3². So, the sum of divisors would be (1 + 2 + 4) × (1 + 3 + 9).

Calculating each part: (1 + 2 + 4) is 7, and (1 + 3 + 9) is 13. Multiplying 7 × 13 gives 91. So, the sum of all divisors, including 36, is 91.

Therefore, the sum of proper divisors is 91 minus 36, which is 55. So
