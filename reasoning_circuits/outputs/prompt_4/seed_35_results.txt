<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, proper divisors... I think that means all the divisors except the number itself, right? So, first, maybe I should list out all the divisors of 36 and then add them up. Let me see... I remember from earlier math classes that 36 is a pretty common number, so maybe I can list its factors systematically.

Starting from 1, since 1 is a divisor of every number. 36 divided by 1 is 36, so 1 and 36 are definitely divisors. Now, what about 2? 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 and 18 are also divisors. Next, 3: 36 divided by 3 is 12, so 3 and 12. Moving on to 4: 36 divided by 4 is 9, so 4 and 9. Then, 5? 36 divided by 5 is 7.2, which isn't an integer, so 5 isn't a divisor. Wait, but 6: 36 divided by 6 is 6, which is a perfect square, so 6 is a divisor as well.

So, putting that together, the divisors I have so far are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. Let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed any. After 6, I had to skip 5 because it didn't divide evenly, but then 6 is its own pair because 6 times 6 is 36. So, 6 is both a proper divisor and 36's square root. Therefore, I think I've got all the divisors.

Now, the next step is to make sure I have all proper divisors. Proper divisors are all divisors excluding the number itself. So, from my list, I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and I need to exclude 36. So, the proper divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18. 

Now, to find their sum, I can add them one by one. Let me do that step by step to minimize any chance of error. Starting with 1 and 2, that's 3. Then, adding 3 makes it 6. Adding 4 brings it to 10. Next, adding 6 gives 16. Then, adding 9 brings it to 25. Adding 12 next: 25 + 12 is 37. Then, adding 18: 37 + 18 is 55.

Wait, let me verify that addition to make sure I didn't skip a number or add incorrectly. Starting again:

1 + 2 = 3,

3 + 3 = 6,

6 + 4 = 10,

10 + 6 = 16,

16 + 9 = 25,

25 + 12 = 37,

37 + 18 = 55.

Yep, that seems to check out. So, the sum of the proper divisors of 36 is 55.

But hold on, is there a formula that can help me verify this result? I remember that for a number, the sum of all its divisors can be found using its prime factorization. Let me try that method as a cross-check.

So, 36 can be factored into primes. 36 is equal to 6 squared, which is (2*3)^2. So, the prime factors are 2^2 * 3^2. 

The formula for the sum of divisors function, σ(n), is (p^(k+1) - 1)/(p - 1) for each prime power p^k in the factorization. Applying this, for the prime 2 with exponent 2, it's (2^(2+1) - 1)/(2 - 1) = (8 - 1)/1 = 7. For the prime 3 with exponent 2, it's (3^(2+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Then, since these prime powers are independent, we multiply the two sums together: 7 * 13 = 91. 

So, the sum of all divisors including 36 is 91. Therefore, the sum of proper divisors is 91 minus 36, which is 55. 

Okay, so that matches my manual addition. That gives me more confidence that 55 is

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, let me think about what a proper divisor is first. If I remember correctly, a proper divisor of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 6 would be 1, 2, and 3, right? Because 6 divided by 1 is 6, 6 divided by 2 is 3, and 6 divided by 3 is 2. But 6 itself isn't considered a proper divisor.

Alright, so applying that to 36, I need to list all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, except for 36 itself. Let me try to list them out step by step.

Starting with 1, because 1 is a divisor of every number. So, 1 is definitely a proper divisor. Then, 2 divides 36 because 36 divided by 2 is 18, which is an integer. So, 2 is another proper divisor. Next, 3 divides 36 because 36 divided by 3 is 12. So, 3 is also a proper divisor.

Moving on, 4. Let me check if 4 divides 36. 36 divided by 4 is 9, which is an integer, so yes, 4 is a proper divisor. What about 5? 36 divided by 5 is 7.2, which isn't an integer, so 5 isn't a divisor. Next, 6. 36 divided by 6 is 6, which is an integer, so 6 is a proper divisor.

Wait, hold on, 6 is a proper divisor because it's not equal to 36. Okay, moving on. 7? 36 divided by 7 is approximately 5.14, so that's not an integer. 8? 36 divided by 8 is 4.5, which isn't an integer either. 9? 36 divided by 9 is 4, so 9 is a proper divisor.

10? 36 divided by 10 is 3.6, not an integer. 11? 36 divided by 11 is about 3.27, so no. 12? 36 divided by 12 is 3, which is an integer, so 12 is a proper divisor.

13? 36 divided by 13 is roughly 2.769, not an integer. 14? 36 divided by 14 is about 2.571, still not an integer. 15? 36 divided by 15 is 2.4, not an integer. 16? 36 divided by 16 is 2.25, which is not an integer. 17? 36 divided by 17 is around 2.117, nope. 18? 36 divided by 18 is 2, which is an integer, so 18 is a proper divisor.

Wait, but 18 is half of 36, right? So, beyond 18, the next number is 19, but 36 divided by 19 is about 1.894, which isn't an integer. 20? 36 divided by 20 is 1.8, not an integer. 21? 36 divided by 21 is about 1.714, not integer. 22? 36 divided by 22 is roughly 1.636, still not. 23? 36 divided by 23 is approximately 1.565, nope. 24? 36 divided by 24 is 1.5, which isn't an integer. 25? 36 divided by 25 is 1.44, not integer. 26? 36 divided by 26 is about 1.384, nope. 27? 36 divided by 27 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. 28? 36 divided by 28 is roughly 1.285, not integer. 29? 36 divided by 29 is about 1.241, nope. 30? 36 divided by 30 is 1.2, not an integer. 31? 36 divided by 31 is approximately 1.161, still not. 32? 36 divided by 32 is 1.125, not integer. 33? 36 divided by 33 is about 1.09, nope. 34? 36 divided by 34 is roughly 1.058, not an integer. 35? 36 divided by 35 is about 1.028, nope. 36? Well, that's the number itself, so it's not a proper divisor.
