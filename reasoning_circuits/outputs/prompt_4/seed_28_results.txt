<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I'll start by determining its prime factorization. The number 36 can be broken down into prime factors as \(2^2 \times 3^2\).

Next, I'll list all the proper divisors of 36. These are the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself. The proper divisors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

Finally, I'll calculate the sum of these proper divisors. Adding them together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 equals 25.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **List the Proper Divisors of 36:**
   
   A proper divisor of a number is a divisor other than the number itself. For **36**, the proper divisors are:
   
   \[
   1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 6,\ 9
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors:**
   
   Add all the proper divisors together:
   
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 = 25
   \]
   
3. **Final Answer:**
   
   The sum of all proper divisors of 36 is:
   
   \[
   \boxed{25}
   \]
