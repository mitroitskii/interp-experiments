<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, proper divisors are the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, but excluding 36 itself, right? So first, maybe I should list out all the divisors of 36. Let me think. 36 is a number I recognize as a square number, since 6 times 6 is 36. So that's a good starting point.

Starting from 1, since 1 divides every number. Then 2, because 36 is even. 3 because the sum of the digits is 9, which is divisible by 3. Next, 4, because 36 divided by 4 is 9. Then, 6, which I already thought about earlier. 9, since as I said, 36 divided by 9 is 4. Wait, 12? Yes, because 12 times 3 is 36. 18, because 18 times 2 is 36. And then 36 itself.

Let me list them out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. So those are all the divisors. Proper divisors would exclude 36, so that leaves me with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18. Now I need to add these up.

Let me try adding them step by step:

Starting with 1. Then add 2: 1 + 2 = 3.

Next, add 3: 3 + 3 = 6.

Then add 4: 6 + 4 = 10.

Add 6: 10 + 6 = 16.

Add 9: 16 + 9 = 25.

Add 12: 25 + 12 = 37.

Add 18: 37 + 18 = 55.

So the sum of all proper divisors is 55. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any divisors or make an arithmetic error.

Alternatively, I remember there's a formula for the sum of divisors, especially when the number is expressed in its prime factorization. So 36 can be factored into primes as 2 squared times 3 squared, right? So 2^2 * 3^2. 

The formula for the sum of divisors is (p^(n+1) - 1)/(p - 1) for each prime p and exponent n, multiplied together. So for 2^2, the sum would be (2^3 - 1)/(2 - 1) = (8 -1)/1 = 7.

For 3^2, the sum is (3^3 -1)/(3 -1) = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13.

Then, the total sum of all divisors is 7 * 13 = 91.

But wait, that's the sum including 36. So the sum of the proper divisors would be 91 minus 36, which is 55. Okay, that confirms the earlier result. So, yeah, 55 is the sum of all proper divisors of 36.

Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in listing or adding earlier, let me list out the proper divisors again: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Let me add them again: 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6+4=10, 10+6=16, 16+9=25, 25+12=37, 37+18=55.

Yep, same result. So it looks like the answer is 55. 

Alternatively, another way to verify is to pair the divisors. In number theory, divisors usually come in pairs that multiply to the number. So for 36, the pairs would be (1,36), (2,18), (3,12), (4,9), (6,6). 

But since we're only considering proper divisors, we need to exclude 36, so the pairs are (1,36), but without 36, which is 1 and itself; similarly, (2,18), (3,12), (4,9), and (6,6). But 6 is not excluded because it's a proper divisor.

Wait, actually, to clarify, when pairing for summing, if the number is not a perfect square, all divisors can be paired neatly. But since 36 is a perfect square, the square root (6) will pair with itself. So

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 36. Hmm, proper divisors are the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, but excluding 36 itself, right? So first, maybe I should list out all the divisors of 36 and then add them up, making sure to exclude 36.

Let me start by recalling that 36 is a composite number, so it has more than just 1 and itself as divisors. I think the best way is to find all the numbers that multiply together to give 36. So, let's break it down.

First, 36 can be factored into prime factors. I remember that 36 is 6 times 6, and 6 is 2 times 3. So, putting that together, 36 is 2 squared times 3 squared, which is \(2^2 \times 3^2\). Yeah, that sounds right.

Now, to find all the divisors, I can use the prime factorization. The formula for the number of divisors is to take the exponents, add one to each, and multiply them. So for 36, that's (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 divisors. Wait, but I'm not just counting them, I need to list them.

To list the divisors, I can consider all the combinations of the prime factors. The exponents for 2 are 0, 1, or 2, and for 3, they are also 0, 1, or 2. So each divisor is of the form \(2^a \times 3^b\), where a is 0,1,2 and b is 0,1,2.

Let me list them:

- When a=0, b=0: \(2^0 \times 3^0 = 1 \times 1 = 1\)
- a=0, b=1: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)
- a=0, b=2: \(1 \times 9 = 9\)
- a=1, b=0: \(2 \times 1 = 2\)
- a=1, b=1: \(2 \times 3 = 6\)
- a=1, b=2: \(2 \times 9 = 18\)
- a=2, b=0: \(4 \times 1 = 4\)
- a=2, b=1: \(4 \times 3 = 12\)
- a=2, b=2: \(4 \times 9 = 36\)

So all the divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. That's nine divisors, which matches the formula. Now, proper divisors exclude the number itself, which is 36, so the proper divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

Now, I need to find the sum of these. Let me add them up step by step:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 12 = 37

37 + 18 = 55

Wait, let me double-check that because 1+2 is 3, then plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 6 is 16, plus 9 is 25, plus 12 is 37, plus 18 is 55. Hmm, seems okay, but let me add them in another way to make sure.

Alternatively, I can pair them:

1 and 36, but wait, 36 is excluded. So pairing the smaller with the larger:

1 + 18 = 19

2 + 12 = 14

3 + 9 = 12

4 + 6 = 10

Now, add those sums: 19 + 14 = 33, 33 + 12 = 45, 45 + 10 = 55. Same result.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the sum of divisors. I think the formula is \( \sigma(n) = (p_1^{k_1 + 1} - 1)/(p_1 - 1) \times ... \times (p_m^{k_m + 1} - 1)/(p_m - 1) \) where \(n = p_1^{k_1} \times p_2^{k_2} \times ...
