<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I start by identifying the prime factors of 36. Breaking it down, 36 equals 2 squared multiplied by 3 squared, which can be written as 2² × 3².

Next, I determine the number of divisors by using the exponents of the prime factors. Adding one to each exponent gives me 3 and 3, respectively. Multiplying these together, there are 9 total divisors of 36.

Now, to find the proper divisors, I exclude 36 itself from the list of divisors. This leaves me with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Finally, I sum these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18. Adding them together gives a total of 55.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Prime Factorization of 36:**
   - 36 can be factored into prime numbers as:
     \[
     36 = 2^2 \times 3^2
     \]

2. **Determine the Total Number of Divisors:**
   - The formula to find the number of divisors is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply the results.
     \[
     \text{Number of Divisors} = (2 + 1) \times (2 + 1) = 3 \times 3 = 9
     \]
   - Therefore, there are **9 divisors** of 36.

3. **List All Proper Divisors:**
   - Proper divisors are all divisors of a number excluding the number itself.
   - The divisors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.
   - Excluding 36, the proper divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.

4. **Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors:**
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{55}
\]

<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I start by identifying the prime factors of 36. Breaking it down, 36 can be expressed as 2 squared multiplied by 3 squared.

Using the formula for the sum of divisors, I calculate the sum of the divisors of 36. This involves adding 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

Finally, to find the sum of the proper divisors, I subtract 36 from the total sum of divisors. This gives me 55.

To find the **sum of all proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

1. **List All Proper Divisors of 36:**
   
   Proper divisors of a number are all the positive divisors excluding the number itself. Let's list them:
   
   \[
   1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 6,\ 9,\ 12,\ 18
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors:**
   
   Now, add all these proper divisors together:
   
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18
   \]
   
   Let's compute step by step:
   
   \[
   1 + 2 = 3
   \]
   \[
   3 + 3 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 + 4 = 10
   \]
   \[
   10 + 6 = 16
   \]
   \[
   16 + 9 = 25
   \]
   \[
   25 + 12 = 37
   \]
   \[
   37 + 18 = 55
   \]
   
3. **Final Answer:**
   
   The sum of all proper divisors of **36** is:
   
   \[
   \boxed{55}
   \]
