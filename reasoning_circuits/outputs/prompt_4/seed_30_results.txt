<｜User｜>What's the sum of all proper divisors of 36?<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find all the proper divisors of 36 and then sum them up. Proper divisors are numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder, excluding 36 itself.

First, I'll list the numbers that divide 36 evenly. Starting from 1, I know that 36 divided by 1 is 36, so 1 is a divisor. Next, 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 and 18 are divisors. Then, 36 divided by 3 is 12, giving us 3 and 12. Continuing this process, 4 and 9 are divisors because 36 divided by 4 is 9. Finally, 6 and 36 are divisors, but since 36 itself is not considered a proper divisor, it will be excluded from the sum.

The proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Adding these together, I calculate 1 plus 2 equals 3, then plus 3 equals 6, plus 4 equals 10, plus 6 equals 16, plus 9 equals 25, and finally, plus 12 equals 37.

Therefore, the sum of all proper divisors of 36 is 37.

To find the sum of all proper divisors of **36**, follow these steps:

1. **List All Proper Divisors:**
   Proper divisors of a number are the divisors excluding the number itself. So, for **36**, the proper divisors are:
   
   \[
   1, \, 2, \, 3, \, 4, \, 6, \, 9, \, 12
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the Sum:**
   Now, add all the proper divisors together:
   
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 37
   \]
   
3. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{37}
   \]

To find the sum of all proper divisors of 36, I will start by identifying all of its divisors.

First, I'll list the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder. These include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

Next, I'll exclude the number itself, which is 36, as we are only interested in proper divisors. This leaves me with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.

Finally, I'll add these proper divisors together to find their sum. Adding them sequentially, I get 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18, which equals 55.

To find the sum of all **proper divisors** of the number **36**, follow these steps:

1. **Identify all divisors of 36:**
   
   A proper divisor of a number is a divisor other than the number itself. Let's list all the numbers that divide 36 without leaving a remainder:
   
   \[
   1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12, \ 18, \ 36
   \]
   
2. **Exclude the number itself:**
   
   Since we're only interested in proper divisors, we remove **36** from the list:
   
   \[
   1, \ 2, \ 3, \ 4, \ 6, \ 9, \ 12, \ 18
   \]
   
3. **Calculate the sum of the proper divisors:**
   
   Add all the numbers in the list:
   
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
   \]
   
4. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{55}
   \]
