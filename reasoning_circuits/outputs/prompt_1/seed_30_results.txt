<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100.

First, I'll consider the smallest prime number, which is 2. If I include 2, the remaining sum to reach 100 is 98. Now, I need to find two primes that add up to 98. Let's try 19 and 79. Both are prime numbers, and 19 + 79 equals 98. Adding 2 to this sum gives 100.

Therefore, the three prime numbers are 2, 19, and 79.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The smallest prime number is 2, followed by 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime (2):**
   - Let's begin by including the smallest prime, which is 2.
   - **Sum Remaining:** \( 100 - 2 = 98 \)

3. **Find Two Prime Numbers That Add Up to 98:**
   - We need to find two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( p + q = 98 \).
   - **Try \( p = 19 \):**
     - \( q = 98 - 19 = 79 \)
     - **Check if 19 and 79 are prime:**
       - 19 is a prime number.
       - 79 is also a prime number.
   - **Verify the Sum:**
     - \( 2 + 19 + 79 = 100 \)

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The three prime numbers that add up to 100 are **2**, **19**, and **79**.

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100.

First, I'll consider even and odd primes since the sum is even. Except for 2, all primes are odd. 

Since 2 is the only even prime, I can check two cases:
- Case 1: One of the primes is 2.
- Case 2: None of the primes is 2.

Starting with Case 1, let 2 be one of the primes. Then the sum of the other two primes will be 100 - 2 = 98. Both primes must be odd since 98 is even. 

I'll look for pairs of primes that add up to 98. Checking possible primes:
- 3 and 95 (95 is not prime)
- 7 and 91 (91 is not prime)
- 13 and 85 (85 is not prime)
- 19 and 79 (both primes)
So, 19 and 79 are both primes. Therefore, one possible set is (2, 19, 79).

Now, let's explore Case 2 without the prime number 2. All three primes must then be odd numbers. The sum of three odd numbers is odd, but 100 is even, which means this case is not possible.

Thus, the only valid set of prime numbers that add up to 100 is (2, 19, 79).
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to **100**, let's follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Understand Prime Numbers**
- A **prime number** is a natural number greater than **1** that has no positive divisors other than **1** and itself.
- The only even prime number is **2**. All other primes are odd.

### **Step 2: Analyze the Problem**
We need three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
\[ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \]

#### **Case 1: One of the Primes is 2**
Since **2** is the only even prime, let's include it:
\[ p_1 = 2 \]
Then the equation becomes:
\[ 2 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \]
\[ p_2 + p_3 = 98 \]
Now, we need two prime numbers that add up to **98**.

#### **Finding Primes for \( p_2 + p_3 = 98 \)**
- **Both \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) must be odd** (since **98** is even, and an even number cannot be expressed as the sum of two odd numbers).
- Start with the smallest prime and check:

  - \( p_2 = 3 \) → \( p_3 = 95 \) (95 is **not** prime)
  - \( p_2 = 7 \) → \( p_3 = 91 \) (91 is **not** prime)
  - \( p_2 = 13 \) → \( p_3 = 85 \) (85 is **not** prime)
  - \( p_2 = 19 \) → \( p_3 = 79 \) (both **19** and **79** are prime)

Thus, one solution is:
\[ (p_1, p_2, p_3) = (2, 19, 79) \]

#### **Case 2: All Three Primes are Odd**
If none of the primes is **2**, then all three are odd. The sum of three odd numbers is odd:
\[ \text{odd} + \text{odd} + \text{odd} = \text{odd} \]
But **100** is even. Therefore, this case is **impossible**.

### **Final Answer**
The three prime numbers that add up to **100** are:
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]
