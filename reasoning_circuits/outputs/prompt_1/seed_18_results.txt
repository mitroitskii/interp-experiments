<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

I'll start by listing the prime numbers less than 100. These include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, and 89.

Next, I'll consider the possibility of including the smallest prime, which is 2, in the trio. This allows the other two numbers to be larger primes.

I'll set one of the numbers as 2 and then look for two additional primes that add up to 98. I'll check pairs of primes to see if their sum is 98. For example, 97 and 1, but 1 is not a prime number. The next pair, 89 and 9, also doesn't work since 9 is not prime. Continuing this process, I find that 83 and 15 do not work, 79 and 19 are both primes, and 79 plus 19 equals 98.

Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 2, 19, and 79.

To find three prime numbers that add up to **100**, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The smallest prime number is **2**.

2. **List of Prime Numbers Less Than 100:**
   \[
   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89
   \]

3. **Strategy:**
   - Start by including the smallest prime, **2**, in the trio.
   - Then, find two other prime numbers that add up to **98** (since \(100 - 2 = 98\)).

4. **Find Prime Pairs That Sum to 98:**
   - **97 + 1**: 1 is not a prime.
   - **89 + 9**: 9 is not a prime.
   - **83 + 15**: 15 is not a prime.
   - **79 + 19**: **Both 79 and 19 are primes.**

5. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   2 + 19 + 79 = 100
   \]

**Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are:**

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

I'll start by listing the prime numbers less than 100, including some larger ones that might be useful.

Next, I'll look for combinations of three prime numbers from this list that sum to 100.

I'll begin with the largest prime number below 100, which is 97. Checking 97 plus the next largest primes, 89, I see that adding 97 + 89 gives me 186, which is way over 100. So, 97 is too big to be part of a three-prime combination that sums to 100.

Moving to the next prime, 89, I'll try 89 plus 7, since 89 is already close to 100. Adding 89 + 7 gives me 96, leaving 4 more needed. However, 4 is not a prime number. Therefore, 89 + 7 + 4 is not valid.

Next, I'll try 83. Starting with 83, I'll add 13, resulting in 96, and then check if 4 is needed. Again, 4 is not prime, so 83 + 13 + 4 is not a valid combination.

Trying 79, I'll add 19, which gives 98, and then need 2. Since 2 is a prime number, the combination 79 + 19 + 2 sums to 100.

Finally, I'll verify by adding 79 + 19 + 2, which equals 100, confirming that these three prime numbers add up to 100.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Understand Prime Numbers
Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The prime numbers less than 100 include:
\[ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 \]

### Step 2: Look for Triplets
We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
\[ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \]

Let's start by testing combinations with smaller primes:

1. **Attempt with 3:**
   - \( 3 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \)
   - \( p_2 + p_3 = 97 \)
   
   Check if both \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) are prime:
   - Possible pairs like \( (89, 8) \) are invalid since 8 is not prime.
   - No valid pairs found.

2. **Attempt with 5:**
   - \( 5 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \)
   - \( p_2 + p_3 = 95 \)
   
   Check for prime pairs summing to 95:
   - \( 89 + 6 \): 6 is not prime.
   - No valid pairs found.

3. **Attempt with 7:**
   - \( 7 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \)
   - \( p_2 + p_3 = 93 \)
   
   Check for prime pairs summing to 93:
   - \( 83 + 10 \): 10 is not prime.
   - \( 79 + 14 \): 14 is not prime.
   - No valid pairs found.

4. **Attempt with 11:**
   - \( 11 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \)
   - \( p_2 + p_3 = 89 \)
   
   Check for prime pairs summing to 89:
   - \( 79 + 10 \): 10 is not prime.
   - \( 83 + 6 \): 6 is not prime.
   - No valid pairs found.

5. **Attempt with 13:**
   - \( 13 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \)
   - \( p_2 + p_3 = 87 \)
   
   Check for prime pairs summing to 87:
   - \( 83 + 4 \): 4 is not prime.
   - \( 79 + 8 \): 8 is not prime.
   - No valid pairs found.
