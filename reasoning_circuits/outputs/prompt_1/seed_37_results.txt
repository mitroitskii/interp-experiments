<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by considering the properties of prime numbers. All prime numbers are greater than 1 and have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Next, I'll think about the even and odd nature of primes. The number 100 is even, so to add up to an even number, the three primes must either be all even or have an even number of odd primes. The only even prime is 2, so if I use 2 as one of the primes, the remaining two primes must add up to 98, which is even.

Now, I'll try different combinations with 2 as one of the primes. For example, if one prime is 3, then the other two primes must add up to 95. I'll check if 95 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Trying 7, I find that 95 - 7 equals 88, but 88 is not a prime number. Trying 13, 95 - 13 equals 82, which is also not prime. Continuing this process, I find that 95 cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes.

I'll then try a larger prime, such as 5. If one prime is 5, the remaining two primes must add up to 93. Checking 7, 93 - 7 equals 86, which is not prime. Trying 11, 93 - 11 equals 82, again not prime. It seems that 93 also cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes.

Finally, I'll try a larger prime, like 7. If one prime is 7, the remaining two primes must add up to 91. Trying 13, 91 - 13 equals 78, which is not prime. Trying 17, 91 - 17 equals 74, which is also not prime. After testing several combinations, I find that 91 cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes either.

Since none of these combinations work, I'll conclude that there are no three prime numbers that add up to 100.

To find three prime numbers that add up to **100**, we'll follow a systematic approach:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The only even prime number is **2**. All other prime numbers are odd.

2. **Analyze the Sum:**
   - **100** is an even number.
   - To get an even sum from three numbers:
     - Either all three numbers are even (but since 2 is the only even prime, this isn't possible with three primes).
     - Or, one number is even (2) and the other two are odd (since odd + odd = even).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let the three primes be \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \), where \( p_1 = 2 \) (the only even prime).
   - Then, \( p_2 + p_3 = 100 - 2 = 98 \).

4. **Find Two Primes Adding Up to 98:**
   - We need to find two prime numbers \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) such that \( p_2 + p_3 = 98 \).
   - Since 98 is even, both \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) must be odd primes.

5. **Check Possible Prime Pairs:**
   - **Example 1:** Let \( p_2 = 3 \), then \( p_3 = 95 \). **95** is not prime (divisible by 5).
   - **Example 2:** Let \( p_2 = 5 \), then \( p_3 = 93 \). **93** is not prime (divisible by 3).
   - **Example 3:** Let \( p_2 = 7 \), then \( p_3 = 91 \). **91** is not prime (divisible by 7 and 13).
   - **Example 4:** Let \( p_2 = 11 \), then \( p_3 = 87 \). **87** is not prime (divisible by 3).
   - **Example 5:** Let \( p_2 = 13 \), then \( p_3 = 85 \). **85** is not prime (divisible by 5).
   - **Example 6:** Let \( p_2 = 17 \), then \( p_3 = 81 \). **81** is not prime (divisible by 3).

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by considering the smallest prime number, which is 3. If I include 3 in the set, the remaining sum needed is 97. Next, I'll look for two prime numbers that add up to 97. One possible pair is 89 and 7, both of which are prime numbers. 

Checking the addition: 3 + 89 + 7 equals 99, which is one less than 100. To reach the exact sum of 100, I'll adjust one of the numbers by increasing it by 1. Replacing 3 with 4 doesn't work since 4 is not a prime number. However, replacing 7 with 11 and adjusting 89 to 91 isn't valid because 91 isn't a prime number. 

Therefore, the most suitable set of prime numbers that add up to 100 is 3, 7, and 89.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \) such that:
   \[
   p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
   \]
   
2. **Start with the Smallest Prime**:
   - Let's start by considering the smallest prime number, which is 3.
   
3. **Find the Remaining Sum**:
   - If \( p_1 = 3 \), then the remaining sum is \( 100 - 3 = 97 \).
   - Now, we need to find two prime numbers \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) such that:
     \[
     p_2 + p_3 = 97
     \]
   
4. **Find Prime Pairs Adding to 97**:
   - Let's look for two prime numbers that add up to 97.
   - One possible pair is \( 89 \) and \( 8 \). However, \( 8 \) is not a prime number.
   - Another pair could be \( 83 \) and \( 14 \). Again, \( 14 \) is not a prime number.
   - A valid pair is \( 79 \) and \( 18 \). However, \( 18 \) is not a prime number.
   - The next pair is \( 73 \) and \( 24 \). \( 24 \) is not a prime number.
   - Continuing this way, we find that \( 89 + 7 = 96 \) is the closest valid pair. However, \( 96 \) is not \( 97 \).
   - Realizing there might be a miscalculation, let's try \( 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \) which is far from 100.
   
5. **Adjust the Approach**:
   - Maybe we need to choose a larger prime for \( p_1 \). Let's try \( p_1 = 5 \).
   - Then \( p_2 + p_3 = 95 \).
   - Look for prime pairs adding to 95:
     - \( 89 + 7 = 96 \) (Not 95)
     - \( 83 + 12 = 95 \) (12 is not prime)
     - \( 79 + 16 = 95 \) (16 is not prime)
   - It seems difficult to find such pairs. Let's try a different approach.
   
6. **Use an Algorithmic Approach**:
   - To systematically find such primes, list all prime numbers less than 100 and check combinations.
   - The prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.
   - We can use a method similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find triplets that sum to 100.
   
7. **Final Solution**:
   - After checking several combinations, one valid set of prime numbers is:
     \[
     3 + 7 + 89 = 99
     \]
   - However, we need the sum to be exactly 100. Adjusting slightly:
     - Replace 3 with 7: \( 7 + 7 + 91 = 105 \) (91 is not prime)
     - Replace 7 with 11: \( 3 + 11
