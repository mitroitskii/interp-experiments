<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by understanding that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

First, I'll consider the largest prime number less than 100, which is 97. Then, I'll check if there are two other prime numbers that add up to 3 (since 100 - 97 = 3).

Next, I'll look for prime numbers that sum to 3. The only prime number less than 3 is 2, and 3 is also a prime number. Adding 2 and 3 gives me 5, which is not equal to 3. Therefore, 97 cannot be part of the solution.

I'll move to the next largest prime number, which is 89. Subtracting 89 from 100 leaves me with 11. Now, I need to find two prime numbers that add up to 11.

Considering the prime numbers less than 11, I find that 3 and 8, 5 and 6, and 7 and 4 are not both prime. However, 3 and 8 are not both prime, and 5 and 6 also do not work. Finally, 7 and 4 are not prime either. It seems there's no pair of primes that add up to 11, so 89 is also not part of the solution.

I'll try the next largest prime number, 83. Subtracting 83 from 100 gives me 17. I need two prime numbers that add up to 17.

Looking for pairs, I find that 3 and 14, 5 and 12, 7 and 10, and 11 and 6 do not work. However, 13 and 4, and 17 and 0 are also not valid. It appears there's no pair of primes that sum to 17, so 83 is not suitable either.

Continuing this process, I'll test the prime number 79. Subtracting 79 from 100 leaves me with 21. I need two primes that add up to 21.

Checking pairs, I find that 3 and 18, 5 and 16, 7 and 14, 11 and 10, 13 and 8, and 17 and 4 do not work. However, 19 and 2 are both prime numbers. Therefore, the primes 79, 19, and 2 add up to 100.

I should verify the sum: 79 + 19 + 2 equals 100. All three numbers are prime numbers. Thus, the solution is 79, 19, and 2.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by understanding that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

First, I'll consider that one of the primes might be 3 since it's a small prime and adding it could make the remaining sum easier to work with. Subtracting 3 from 100 gives 97, so now I need two prime numbers that add up to 97.

Next, I'll check if 97 itself is a prime. After testing divisibility by prime numbers up to its square root, I confirm that 97 is a prime. This means I can express 97 as 97 + 3, but that would leave 0, which isn't valid. Therefore, I need to find different primes.

I'll try subtracting 5 from 97, giving me 92. Now I need to find if there are primes that add up to 92. Dividing 92 by 2 gives me 46, but 2 is the only even prime, so it's worth considering.

If I take 2 as one of the primes, the remaining sum to reach 100 is 98. I'll check if 98 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Dividing 98 by 2 gives me 49, and since both 49 and 2 are primes, their sum is 51, not 98. This means 2 isn't the right choice for this combination.

Instead, I'll try subtracting another even prime, such as 3, from 92, leaving 89. Now, I need to check if 89 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Testing different pairs, I find that 89 can be expressed as 83 + 6, 83 is a prime, and 6 is not. Continuing this process, I find that 89 can be expressed as 79 + 10, where 79 is a prime and 10 is not. Finally, I discover that 89 can be expressed as 7 + 82, with 7 being a prime and 82 not. It seems that this path isn't leading me to a valid solution.

I'll revert to the initial approach and try a different starting prime. Instead of 3, I'll start with 7. Subtracting 7 from 100 leaves 93. I'll check if 93 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Dividing 93 by 2 gives me 46.5, which isn't an integer, so 2 is not the right choice here. Trying 3 as the second prime, I subtract 3 from 93 to get 90. Now, I need to express 90 as the sum of two primes. 

I'll start by testing if 7 is a prime and then check if 83 is also a prime. Both 7 and 83 are primes, so their sum is 90. Adding 7 and 3 to the initial 7 gives me the three primes: 7, 7, and 3. However, 7 is repeated, so it might not be the most optimal solution.

Continuing with 93, I'll try subtracting 5 to get 88. Now, I need to find two primes that add up to 88. Subtracting 3 from 88 gives 85, which needs to be expressed as the sum of two primes. Trying 5 and 80, I find that 80 is not a prime. This path doesn't yield a solution either.

Reverting again, I'll try subtracting 5 from 100, leaving 95. To express 95 as the sum of two primes, I'll start with 3 and get 92. Then, I'll check if 92 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Trying 5 and 87, I find that 87 is not a prime. Continuing with 7 and 85, 85 is also not a prime. This approach doesn't work either.

After several attempts, I realize that a systematic approach would be more efficient. I'll list all primes less than 100 and try different combinations. Starting with 3, 5, 7, and 11, I'll combine them in different ways to see which triples add up to 100.

Finally, I find that 3, 5, and 7 add up to 15, which is much less than 100. I'll need to use larger primes. After some trial and error, I find that 19, 7, and 3 add up to 29, still not 100. Realizing the need for larger primes, I try 19, 7, and 73, which sum to 100. However, verifying if these are primes and their
