<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by listing the prime numbers less than 100 to have a reference.

Next, I'll consider the properties of prime numbers. Except for 2, all primes are odd. Since 100 is an even number, I should determine whether 2 is part of the solution or not. If 2 is included, the sum of the remaining two primes must be 98, which is also even. This means both of those primes must be odd, which is possible.

I'll begin by assuming that one of the primes is 2. Then, I'll look for two primes that add up to 98. I'll check various pairs and find that 19 and 79 are both primes and satisfy this condition.

To verify, I'll add them up: 2 + 19 + 79 = 100. All three numbers are prime, so this combination is valid.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Except for the number 2, all prime numbers are odd.

2. **Analyze the Problem:**
   - We need three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
     \[
     p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
     \]
   - Since 100 is an even number, we should consider whether 2 (the only even prime) is part of the solution.

3. **Case 1: Include 2 as One of the Primes**
   - Let \( p_1 = 2 \). Then:
     \[
     p_2 + p_3 = 100 - 2 = 98
     \]
   - Both \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) must be odd primes because 98 is even, and the sum of two odd numbers is even.
   
4. **Find Prime Pairs Adding to 98**
   - Let's look for prime pairs \( (p_2, p_3) \) such that their sum is 98.
   - After testing several pairs:
     - \( p_2 = 19 \) and \( p_3 = 79 \)
     - Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers.
     - Their sum:
       \[
       19 + 79 = 98
       \]
   
5. **Verify the Solution**
   - Now, check if all three numbers are prime:
     - 2 is prime.
     - 19 is prime.
     - 79 is prime.
   - Their total sum:
     \[
     2 + 19 + 79 = 100
     \]
   
6. **Conclusion**
   - The three prime numbers are:
     \[
     \boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
     \]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by listing the prime numbers less than 100 to have a reference.

Next, I'll consider the properties of prime numbers. Except for 2, all primes are odd. Since 100 is an even number, I know that to get an even sum from three numbers, there must be either one even prime and two odd primes or all three primes are even. Since only 2 is even and prime, there can only be one even prime in the triplet.

I'll try including 2 in the triplet. This leaves me with 98 to be divided between two odd primes. I'll look for two primes that add up to 98. 

Trying 47 and 51: 51 is not prime.
Trying 53 and 45: 45 is not prime.
Trying 59 and 39: 39 is not prime.
Trying 61 and 37: Both are prime, and their sum is 98.

So, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 2, 37, and 61.

To find three prime numbers that add up to **100**, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than **1** that have no divisors other than **1** and themselves.
   - The only even prime number is **2**. All other primes are odd.

2. **Analyze the Problem:**
   - We need three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
     \[
     p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
     \]
   - Since **100** is an even number and all primes except **2** are odd, we must have **1 even prime** (which can only be **2**) and **2 odd primes**.

3. **Find Possible Primes:**
   - **Let’s include the even prime:**
     - \( p_1 = 2 \)
   - Now, find two odd primes \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) such that:
     \[
     p_2 + p_3 = 100 - 2 = 98
     \]
   - We need to find two prime numbers that add up to **98**.

4. **Check for Prime Pairs:**
   - Since **98** is even, one of the primes must be **2** (the only even prime), and the other must be **96**. However, **96** is not prime.
   - Therefore, both primes must be odd. Let's find such pairs:
     - \( 37 + 61 = 98 \)
     - **37** and **61** are both primes.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The three prime numbers are \( 2, 37, \) and \( 61 \).

\[
\boxed{2,\, 37,\, 61}
\]
