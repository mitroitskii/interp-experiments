<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. To simplify, I'll consider the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see if it can be part of the solution.

If one of the primes is 2, then the sum of the other two primes must be 98. Now, I'll look for two prime numbers that add up to 98. I'll start by checking if 98 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

I'll try pairing 3 with 95, 5 with 93, 7 with 91, and 11 with 87. However, none of these pairs are both prime. Moving on, I'll check higher primes until I find a valid pair.

After testing several combinations, I find that 19 and 79 are both prime numbers and their sum is 98. Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 2, 19, and 79.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \) such that:
   \[
   p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
   \]
   
2. **Consider the Smallest Prime (2):**
   Start by considering the smallest prime number, which is 2. If one of the primes is 2, then the sum of the other two primes must be:
   \[
   100 - 2 = 98
   \]
   
3. **Find Two Primes That Add Up to 98:**
   Now, we need to find two prime numbers \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) such that:
   \[
   p_2 + p_3 = 98
   \]
   
   Let's check possible pairs:
   
   - **Pair (3, 95):**  
     3 is prime, but 95 is not (since \( 95 = 5 \times 19 \)).
     
   - **Pair (5, 93):**  
     5 is prime, but 93 is not (since \( 93 = 3 \times 31 \)).
     
   - **Pair (7, 91):**  
     7 is prime, but 91 is not (since \( 91 = 7 \times 13 \)).
     
   - **Pair (11, 87):**  
     11 is prime, but 87 is not (since \( 87 = 3 \times 29 \)).
     
   - **Pair (13, 85):**  
     13 is prime, but 85 is not (since \( 85 = 5 \times 17 \)).
     
   - **Pair (17, 81):**  
     17 is prime, but 81 is not (since \( 81 = 9 \times 9 \)).
     
   - **Pair (19, 79):**  
     Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers.
     
     \[
     19 + 79 = 98
     \]
     
4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Now, we have:
   \[
   2 + 19 + 79 = 100
   \]
   
   All three numbers (2, 19, and 79) are prime numbers.

5. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
   \]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. To simplify, I'll consider the smallest prime number, which is 2.

If I include 2 in the trio, the sum of the other two primes needs to be 98. I'll then look for two primes that add up to 98. 

By testing different combinations, I find that 19 and 79 are both prime numbers and their sum is 98. 

Finally, adding 2 to 19 and 79 gives a total of 100. Therefore, the three prime numbers are 2, 19, and 79.
</think>

**Question:** Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.

**Solution:**

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the smallest prime number:**  
   The smallest prime number is **2**. Including **2** in our trio will simplify the problem because we only need two more primes that add up to \(100 - 2 = 98\).

2. **Find two primes that add up to 98:**  
   We'll look for two prime numbers that sum to 98. Let's denote these two primes as \( p \) and \( q \) such that:
   \[
   p + q = 98
   \]
   
3. **Test possible pairs:**  
   Start testing prime numbers less than 98 to find a pair that adds up to 98.
   
   - **Check \( p = 19 \):**
     \[
     q = 98 - 19 = 79
     \]
     - **Check if 79 is prime:**
       - 79 is divisible only by 1 and itself, so **79 is a prime number**.
   
   - **Therefore, the pair \( p = 19 \) and \( q = 79 \) works** since both are prime and \( 19 + 79 = 98 \).

4. **Verify the total sum:**  
   Add all three primes:
   \[
   2 + 19 + 79 = 100
   \]
   
5. **Final Answer:**  
   The three prime numbers are **2**, **19**, and **79**.

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]
