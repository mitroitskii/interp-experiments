<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by understanding the properties of prime numbers. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Next, I'll consider the even and odd nature of prime numbers. The only even prime number is 2, so if I include 2 in the sum, the remaining two primes must add up to 98. Since 98 is even, both of these primes must be odd.

I'll list some prime numbers less than 100 and look for pairs that add up to 98. Checking pairs like 19 and 79, 23 and 75 (but 75 is not prime), 29 and 69 (69 is not prime), 31 and 67, 37 and 61, and 43 and 55 (55 is not prime), I find that 19 and 79 are both primes and add up to 98.

Finally, adding 2 to 19 and 79 gives me three prime numbers: 2, 19, and 79, which sum up to 100.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.
   - The only even prime number is **2**. All other prime numbers are odd.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   \[
   p + q + r = 100
   \]
   Where \( p \), \( q \), and \( r \) are prime numbers.

3. **Consider the Parity:**
   - If one of the primes is **2** (the only even prime), the sum of the other two primes must be \( 100 - 2 = 98 \).
   - Since 98 is even, the other two primes must both be odd (because the sum of two odd numbers is even).

4. **Find Prime Pairs Adding to 98:**
   - We look for two prime numbers that add up to 98.
   - After testing several pairs:
     - \( 19 + 79 = 98 \) (Both 19 and 79 are primes.)

5. **Determine the Three Primes:**
   - Adding **2** to the pair:
     \[
     2 + 19 + 79 = 100
     \]
   - All three numbers are prime.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by understanding the problem. I need three prime numbers whose sum is exactly 100, and each number should be prime.

I remember that 2 is the only even prime number. Since the sum 100 is even, the combination of three primes must include an even number to achieve an even total. Therefore, one of the primes must be 2.

Now, I'll set one of the primes as 2 and look for two other prime numbers that add up to 98. Let me list the possible prime numbers less than 98. Starting from 3, I'll add each prime number to 2 and check if the sum is 100.

If I take 3 as the second prime, then the third prime would need to be 95. However, 95 is not a prime number because it's divisible by 5. Moving on, the next prime is 5, which makes the third prime 93. But 93 is also divisible by 3, so it's not prime. Continuing this process, when I try 7, the third number becomes 91, which is not prime either. The same issue arises with 11, resulting in 87, and 13, which gives 85. These numbers are all divisible by smaller primes.

Next, trying 17 as the second prime, the third number becomes 81, which is not prime. The same problem occurs with 19, yielding 79. Although 79 is prime, I need to ensure that both numbers I've chosen are prime, which they are. Therefore, the combination 2, 19, and 79 adds up to 100 and all are prime numbers.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Understand the Properties of Prime Numbers**
- Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.
- The only even prime number is **2**. All other prime numbers are odd.

**Step 2: Identify the Implications for the Sum 100**
- Since **100** is an even number, the sum of three primes must include at least one even number. The only even prime is **2**.
- Therefore, one of the primes in the trio must be **2**.

**Step 3: Express the Sum with 2 as One Prime**
- Let's set **2** as one of the primes: 
  \[
  2 + p + q = 100
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  p + q = 98
  \]
  
**Step 4: Identify Prime Numbers Less Than 98**
- We need to find two prime numbers that add up to **98**.
- Start by testing prime numbers from **3** upwards and check if the complement (98 - prime) is also a prime number.

**Step 5: Test Possible Prime Numbers**
- **3**: 
  \[
  98 - 3 = 95 \quad (\text{95 is not prime})
  \]
- **5**: 
  \[
  98 - 5 = 93 \quad (\text{93 is not prime})
  \]
- **7**: 
  \[
  98 - 7 = 91 \quad (\text{91 is not prime})
  \]
- **11**: 
  \[
  98 - 11 = 87 \quad (\text{87 is not prime})
  \]
- **13**: 
  \[
  98 - 13 = 85 \quad (\text{85 is not prime})
  \]
- **17**: 
  \[
  98 - 17 = 81 \quad (\text{81 is not prime})
  \]
- **19**: 
  \[
  98 - 19 = 79 \quad (\text{79 is prime})
  \]
  
**Step 6: Verify the Valid Combination**
- The primes **19** and **79** are both prime, and their sum is:
  \[
  19 + 79 = 98
  \]
- Adding the initial prime **2**:
  \[
  2 + 19 + 79 = 100
  \]
  
**Final Answer**
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]
