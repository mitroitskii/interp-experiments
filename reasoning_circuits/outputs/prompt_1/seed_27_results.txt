<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.

First off, I know that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. So, if I'm adding three primes together, the sum will depend on whether I include 2 or not. Since 2 is the only even prime, it's going to play a crucial role here because 100 is an even number.

Let me consider the possibilities:

1. All three primes are odd. Then, the sum of three odd numbers would be odd + odd + odd = odd + odd = even + odd = odd. But 100 is even, so this case is impossible. Therefore, not all three primes can be odd. So, one of them must be 2.

2. So, one prime is 2, and the other two are odd primes. That makes sense because 2 is even, and adding two odd numbers will give an even result, so 2 + even = even, which is 100. So, now the problem reduces to finding two primes that add up to 98 (since 100 - 2 = 98).

Alright, now I need to find two primes that add up to 98. Let's denote them as p and q, so p + q = 98. Both p and q are primes, and since they are adding to an even number, they must both be odd primes because 2 is the only even prime. So, p and q are odd.

Let me think about how to find such primes. One way is to check pairs of primes that add up to 98. Maybe starting from the smaller primes and moving upwards.

Let me list some primes less than 98:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Wait, 97 is larger than 98, so it's not needed here. Let me start checking pairs:

Start with 3: 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 prime? 95 is divisible by 5 (since it ends with a 5), so no.

Next prime: 5. 98 - 5 = 93. 93 is divisible by 3 (9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3), so not prime.

Next: 7. 98 - 7 = 91. 91 is 7*13, so not prime.

Next: 11. 98 - 11 = 87. 87 is divisible by 3 (8 + 7 = 15), so not prime.

Next: 13. 98 - 13 = 85. 85 is divisible by 5, so not prime.

Next: 17. 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9*9, so not prime.

Next: 19. 98 - 19 = 79. Hmm, 79 is a prime number. So, 19 and 79 are both primes, and 19 + 79 = 98. So, that works.

Therefore, the three primes would be 2, 19, and 79. Let me check: 2 + 19 + 79 = 100. Yep, that adds up.

Wait, just to make sure there are no other possibilities, let me see if there are other pairs.

Continuing from where I left off:

23. 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5, so not prime.

29. 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is divisible by 3, so not prime.

31. 98 - 31 = 67. 67 is a prime number. So, 31 and 67. 31 + 67 = 98. So, that's another pair. Therefore, the primes would be 2, 31, and 67. Let me check: 2 + 31 + 67 = 100. Correct.

Continuing further:

37. 98 - 37 = 61. 61 is prime. So, 37 and 61. 37 + 61 = 98. So, primes 2, 37, 61. Check: 2 + 37 + 61 = 100. Correct.

Next prime: 41. 98 - 41 = 57. 57 is divisible by

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should note that except for 2, all other prime numbers are odd. That means if I have an odd number of primes, their sum would be odd, and if I have an even number of primes, their sum would be even. Here, I'm adding three primes. So, let me analyze the parity:

- If all three primes are odd, their sum will be odd (since odd + odd + odd = odd).
- If one prime is 2 (the only even prime), and the other two are odd, their sum will be even + odd + odd = even + even = even.

Since 100 is even, we need the sum of the three primes to be even. Therefore, one of them has to be 2, and the other two have to be odd primes.

So, I can represent the primes as 2, p, and q, where p and q are odd primes. Therefore, 2 + p + q = 100 ⇒ p + q = 98.

Now, I need to find two prime numbers p and q such that p + q = 98.

I need to check pairs of primes that add up to 98.

Let me list some primes less than 98 and see which pairs sum to 98.

Wait, maybe I should start by recalling that 98 is an even number. Since 98 is even, and as per the Goldbach conjecture, every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Although this conjecture hasn't been proven for all numbers, it's held for a very large set.

So, let me check for prime pairs adding to 98.

Start with the smallest prime after 2, which is 3.

98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 a prime? 95 is divisible by 5 (since it ends with a 5), so it's not prime.

Next, check 7: 98 - 7 = 91. 91 is 13 times 7, so not prime.

Next, 11: 98 - 11 = 87. 87 is divisible by 3 (since 8 + 7 = 15, which is divisible by 3), so not prime.

Next, 13: 98 - 13 = 85. 85 ends with 5, divisible by 5, not prime.

17: 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9 times 9, so not prime.

19: 98 - 19 = 79. Now, is 79 a prime? Let me think. 79 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Let's check: 79 divided by 2 is not integer, 79 divided by 3 is 26.333..., 79 divided by 5 is 15.8, 7? 79/7 ≈11.285..., 11? 79/11≈7.18... So, yes, 79 is a prime.

So, 19 and 79 are primes, and they add up to 98. Therefore, the three primes are 2, 19, and 79.

Let me check: 2 + 19 = 21, and 21 + 79 = 100. Yep, that works.

But just to make sure I haven't missed anything, maybe there's another pair as well.

Let me check another prime: 23. 98 -23 =75. 75 is divisible by 5, not prime.

29: 98 -29=69. 69 is divisible by 3, not prime.

31: 98 -31=67. Is 67 a prime? Let's see: 67 is not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11. 67/7≈9.57. So yes, 67 is prime. Therefore, 31 and 67 are primes that add to 98. So, 2,31,67 also add to 100.

Let me check: 2 +31=33, 33 +67=100. Correct.

Similarly, let's check another one for thoroughness. 37: 98-37=61. 61 is a prime. So, 37 and 61 are primes. Therefore, 2,37,61 is another triplet.

Check: 2+37=39, 39 +61=100. Perfect.

Continuing, 41: 98-41=57. 57 is divisible by 3
