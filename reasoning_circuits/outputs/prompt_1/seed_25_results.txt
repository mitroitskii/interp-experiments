<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by considering the smallest prime number, which is 3. Adding this to itself gives 6, leaving 94 to be split between two primes.

Next, I'll try the prime number 5. Adding 5 twice gives 10, which leaves 90 to be divided between two primes.

Finally, I'll test the prime number 7. Adding 7 twice results in 14, leaving 86 to be split between two primes. After several attempts, I find that 3, 5, and 7 add up to 100, making them the prime numbers I'm looking for.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \) such that:
   \[
   p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
   \]
   
2. **Start with the Smallest Prime:**
   The smallest prime number is 3. Let's try using it as one of the primes.
   
   - **First Attempt:**
     \[
     3 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_2 + p_3 = 97
     \]
     Now, we need two primes that add up to 97.
     
3. **Try the Next Prime:**
   Let's try using 5 as the second prime.
   
   - **Second Attempt:**
     \[
     3 + 5 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_3 = 92
     \]
     However, 92 is not a prime number.
     
4. **Adjust and Try Again:**
   Since 92 isn't prime, let's try increasing the second prime to 7.
   
   - **Third Attempt:**
     \[
     3 + 7 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_3 = 90
     \]
     Again, 90 is not a prime number.
     
5. **Continue Testing with Larger Primes:**
   Let's try the next prime, 11.
   
   - **Fourth Attempt:**
     \[
     3 + 11 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_3 = 86
     \]
     86 is not a prime number.
     
6. **Try the Next Prime:**
   Let's try 13.
   
   - **Fifth Attempt:**
     \[
     3 + 13 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_3 = 84
     \]
     84 is not a prime number.
     
7. **Continue with the Next Prime:**
   Let's try 17.
   
   - **Sixth Attempt:**
     \[
     3 + 17 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_3 = 80
     \]
     80 is not a prime number.
     
8. **Next Prime:**
   Let's try 19.
   
   - **Seventh Attempt:**
     \[
     3 + 19 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_3 = 78
     \]
     78 is not a prime number.
     
9. **Continue Testing:**
   Let's try 23.
   
   - **Eighth Attempt:**
     \[
     3 + 23 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_3 = 74
     \]
     74 is not a prime number.
     
10. **Next Prime:**
    Let's try 29.
    
    - **Ninth Attempt:**
      \[
      3 + 29 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_3 = 68
      \]
      68 is not a prime number.
    
11. **Continue Testing:**
    Let's try 31.
    
    - **Tenth Attempt:**
      \[
      3 + 31 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_3 = 66
      \]
      66 is not a prime number.

    Let's try 37.
    
    - **Eleventh Attempt:**
      \[
      3 + 37 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_3 = 60
      \]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by considering the smallest prime number, which is 3. Adding this to itself gives 6, leaving 94 as the remaining sum. Checking if 94 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, I notice that 94 is even and greater than 2, so it's divisible by 2. However, 91 is not a prime number since it's divisible by 13. Therefore, 3 cannot be part of the solution.

Next, I'll try the next prime number, which is 5. Adding 5 to itself results in 10, leaving 90 as the remaining sum. I'll check if 90 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Dividing 90 into two parts, I find that 90 minus 7 equals 83, which is a prime number. Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 5, 7, and 88. However, upon closer inspection, 88 is not a prime number because it's divisible by 2, 8, and 11.

Since 5 and 7 did not work, I'll move to the next prime number, 7. Adding 7 to itself gives 14, leaving 86 as the remaining sum. Checking if 86 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, I'll subtract smaller prime numbers from 86. Subtracting 5 from 86 gives 81, which is not a prime. Subtracting 7 from 86 gives 79, which is a prime number. Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 7, 7, and 86. However, 86 is not a prime number as it's divisible by 2.

Since none of the combinations with 5 and 7 worked, I'll try the next prime number, 11. Adding 11 to itself results in 22, leaving 78 as the remaining sum. Checking if 78 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, subtracting 5 from 78 gives 73, which is a prime number. Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 11, 5, and 84. However, 84 is not a prime number as it's divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 84.

Since the combinations with 5 and 11 also didn't work, I'll try the next prime number, 13. Adding 13 to itself gives 26, leaving 74 as the remaining sum. Checking if 74 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, subtracting 5 from 74 gives 69, which is not a prime. Subtracting 7 from 74 gives 67, which is a prime number. Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 13, 7, and 80. However, 80 is not a prime number as it's divisible by 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, and 80.

Continuing this process, I'll try the next prime number, 17. Adding 17 to itself results in 34, leaving 66 as the remaining sum. Checking if 66 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, subtracting 5 from 66 gives 61, which is a prime number. Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 17, 5, and 68. However, 68 is not a prime number as it's divisible by 2, 4, 17, and 34.

After testing several prime numbers, I find that none of the combinations where one prime is 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 yield three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll need to try higher prime numbers to see if a valid combination exists.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's systematically explore the possibilities.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
     \[
     p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
     \]
   - **Prime Number Reminder:** A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Strategy:**
   - Start with the smallest prime numbers and work your way up.
   - Ensure that each combination sums to exactly 100.

3. **Step-by-Step Solution:**
