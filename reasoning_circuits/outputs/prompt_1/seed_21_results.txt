<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by considering the properties of prime numbers, which are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Since the sum of three prime numbers is 100, and 2 is the only even prime number, one of the primes must be 2 to make the sum odd. This leaves 98 to be divided between the other two primes.

Next, I'll look for pairs of primes that add up to 98. By testing various combinations, I find that 17 and 81 are both prime numbers. Adding them together gives 98, so the three primes are 2, 17, and 81.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The only even prime number is **2**. All other prime numbers are odd.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   \[
   p + q + r = 100
   \]
   Where \( p \), \( q \), and \( r \) are prime numbers.

3. **Consider the Parity:**
   - Since **2** is the only even prime, let's include it in our sum.
   \[
   2 + q + r = 100 \implies q + r = 98
   \]
   - Now, we need two prime numbers \( q \) and \( r \) that add up to **98**.

4. **Find Prime Pairs Adding to 98:**
   - Start by testing pairs of primes:
     - \( 17 + 81 = 98 \) (Both 17 and 81 are prime numbers.)
     - \( 19 + 79 = 98 \) (Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers.)
     - \( 23 + 75 = 98 \) (75 is not a prime number.)
     - \( 29 + 69 = 98 \) (69 is not a prime number.)
     - \( 31 + 67 = 98 \) (Both 31 and 67 are prime numbers.)

5. **Choose a Valid Combination:**
   - Let's select the pair \( 17 \) and \( 81 \) for simplicity.
   - Therefore, the three prime numbers are:
     \[
     2, \quad 17, \quad 81
     \]
   - Verify the sum:
     \[
     2 + 17 + 81 = 100
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{2,\ 17,\ 81}
   \]

I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by recalling that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

First, I'll list some prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Since the target sum is 100 and 2 is the only even prime number, I should consider using it as one of the primes to ensure the other numbers can be odd primes.

Using the Goldbach Conjecture as a guide, I'll attempt to find pairs of primes that add up to 98 (since 100 - 2 = 98). Checking combinations, I find that 97 and 1 are not both prime, but 89 and 9 are not. Trying 83 and 15, neither are prime. 

Finally, I test 73 and 25, which also aren't both prime. However, 7 and 8 are not prime either. After exhausting these options, I conclude that 3, 5, and 92 do not work. 

Since no suitable pairs are found, I'll try using two even primes. But since 2 is the only even prime, this approach isn't feasible. Therefore, the original approach using one even prime doesn't yield a solution either.

As a result, there are no sets of three prime numbers that add up to 100.

**Solution:**

We are tasked with finding three prime numbers that add up to 100. Let's denote these primes as \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \). Our goal is to solve the following equation:

\[
p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
\]

**Step 1: Understanding Prime Numbers**

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The prime numbers less than 100 are:

\[
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
\]

**Step 2: Analyzing the Equation**

Since all prime numbers except for 2 are odd, and the sum of three odd numbers is odd. However, 100 is an even number. This implies that we must include the prime number 2 in our triplet to have an even sum.

**Step 3: Setting Up the Equation with 2**

Let’s set \( p_1 = 2 \). Then the equation becomes:

\[
2 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \implies p_2 + p_3 = 98
\]

**Step 4: Finding Primes that Add Up to 98**

We need two primes \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) such that:

\[
p_2 + p_3 = 98
\]

Let’s test various pairs of primes that add up to 98:

1. \( 97 + 1 \) – Not both primes.
2. \( 89 + 9 \) – 9 is not prime.
3. \( 83 + 15 \) – 15 is not prime.
4. \( 79 + 19 \) – Both are primes!

**Step 5: Identifying the Solution**

We have found that:

\[
p_2 = 19 \quad \text{and} \quad p_3 = 79
\]

**Step 6: Verifying the Solution**

Let’s verify that all three numbers are prime and that their sum is 100:

\[
2 + 19 + 79 = 100
\]

All numbers are prime, and their sum is correct.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]
