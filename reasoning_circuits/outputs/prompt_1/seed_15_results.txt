<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by considering the properties of prime numbers, which are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

I'll begin by listing some of the prime numbers less than 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

Next, I'll think about how to combine these primes to reach a total of 100. Since 2 is the only even prime number, using it will allow the other two primes to be odd, which is necessary because the sum of two odd numbers is even, and adding 2 will result in an odd total.

Let's try pairing 2 with two other primes. If one of the other primes is 3, then the third prime needs to be 95. However, 95 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5 and 19.

If I try pairing 2 with 5, then the third prime must be 93. Again, 93 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3 and 31.

Next, pairing 2 with 7 means the third prime needs to be 91. Although 91 is not immediately obvious as a prime, upon further inspection, it is divisible by 7 and 13, so it is not a prime number.

Trying 2 with 11 results in the third prime being 87. 87 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 29.

Continuing this process, pairing 2 with 13 gives the third prime as 85, which is not prime since it is divisible by 5 and 17.

If I pair 2 with 17, the third prime needs to be 81. 81 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 9 and 3.

Moving forward, pairing 2 with 19 requires the third prime to be 79. 79 is a prime number, so this combination works.

Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 19, 2, and 79.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Properties of Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The only even prime number is **2**. All other prime numbers are odd.

2. **Identify the Target Sum:**
   - We need three prime numbers that add up to **100**.

3. **Consider the Use of 2:**
   - Since 2 is the only even prime, including it in the set allows the other two primes to be odd. This is necessary because:
     - Odd + Odd = Even
     - Even + Odd = Odd
   - Therefore, if we include **2**, the sum of the other two primes must be **98** (because \(100 - 2 = 98\)).

4. **Find Two Prime Numbers That Add Up to 98:**
   - We'll look for two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( p + q = 98 \).
   - Start by listing prime numbers less than 98:
     \[
     3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
     \]
   - Try pairing each prime with another to see if their sum is 98:
     - **3 + 95 = 98** → 95 is **not** prime (divisible by 5 and 19).
     - **5 + 93 = 98** → 93 is **not** prime (divisible by 3 and 31).
     - **7 + 91 = 98** → 91 is **not** prime (divisible by 7 and 13).
     - **11 + 87 = 98** → 87 is **not** prime (divisible by 3 and 29).
     - **13 + 85 = 98** → 85 is **not** prime (divisible by 5 and 17).
     - **17 +

First, I need to identify three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by considering the properties of prime numbers, which are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

I'll begin by listing some small prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and so on. Since the sum needs to be 100, which is an even number, I realize that 2 is a useful prime because it's the only even prime, and adding it might help in achieving an even total.

Next, I'll test combinations of these primes. Starting with 2, I'll subtract it from 100 to get 98. Now, I'll look for two prime numbers that add up to 98. I'll consider prime numbers less than 98 and check if their sum equals 98. 

Trying 3 and 95, but 95 is not a prime. Moving on, I'll try 5 and 93, but 93 isn't prime either. Testing 7 and 91, 91 is 7 multiplied by 13, so it's not prime. Continuing this process, I find that 17 and 81 don't work since 81 is not prime. 

Repeating this method, I discover that 19 and 79 are both primes, and their sum is 98. Therefore, the three primes I'm looking for are 2, 19, and 79. Adding them together, 2 + 19 + 79 indeed equals 100.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.
   - The first few prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.

2. **Consider Even Prime:**
   - The only even prime number is **2**. Since the total sum is even (100), including 2 can help achieve the desired total.

3. **Find Two More Primes:**
   - Subtract 2 from 100:  
     \( 100 - 2 = 98 \)
   - Now, we need two prime numbers that add up to 98.

4. **Check Possible Prime Pairs:**
   - **3 and 95:** 95 is **not** a prime (divisible by 5).
   - **5 and 93:** 93 is **not** a prime (divisible by 3).
   - **7 and 91:** 91 is **not** a prime (7 × 13).
   - **11 and 87:** 87 is **not** a prime (divisible by 3).
   - **13 and 85:** 85 is **not** a prime (divisible by 5).
   - **17 and 81:** 81 is **not** a prime (9 × 9).
   - **19 and 79:** Both are **primes**.
   
5. **Final Combination:**
   - The three prime numbers are **2, 19,** and **79**.
   
6. **Verification:**
   - \( 2 + 19 + 79 = 100 \)

\(\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}\)

Next, I'll think about how to combine these primes to reach a total of 100. Since 2 is the only even prime number, using it will allow the other two primes to be odd, which is necessary because the sum of two odd numbers is even, and adding 2 will result in an odd total.

Let's try pairing 2 with two other primes. If one of the other primes is 3, then the third prime needs to be 95. However, 95 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5 and 19.

If I try pairing 2 with 5, then the third prime must be 93. Again, 93 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3 and 31.

Next, pairing 2 with 7 means the third prime needs to be 91. Although 91 is not immediately obvious as a prime, upon further inspection, it is divisible by 7 and 13, so it is not a prime number.

Trying 2 with 11 results in the third prime being 87. 87 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 29.

Continuing this process, pairing 2 with 13 gives the third prime as 85, which is not prime since it is divisible by 5 and 17.

If I pair 2 with 17, the third prime needs to be 81. 81 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 9 and 3.

Moving forward, pairing 2 with 19 requires the third prime to be 79. 79 is a prime number, so this combination works.

Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 19, 2, and 79.

   - Try pairing each prime with another to see if their sum is 98:
     - **3 + 95 = 98** → 95 is **not** prime (divisible by 5 and 19).
     - **5 + 93 = 98** → 93 is **not** prime (divisible by 3 and 31).
     - **7 + 91 = 98** → 91 is **not** prime (divisible by 7 and 13).
     - **11 + 87 = 98** → 87 is **not** prime (divisible by 3 and 29).
     - **13 + 85 = 98** → 85 is **not** prime (divisible by 5 and 17).
