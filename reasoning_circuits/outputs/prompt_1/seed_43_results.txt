<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by considering the properties of prime numbers. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

I'll begin by listing some of the smaller prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and so on. Since 2 is the only even prime number, I'll set aside 2 and work with the remaining odd primes to keep the sum odd.

Next, I'll aim for a combination where the sum of three odd primes equals 100. Adding three odd numbers results in an odd total, which is not possible since 100 is even. Therefore, I must include the number 2 in the set to make the sum even.

I'll try pairing 2 with two other primes and see if their sum equals 98. Trying 19 and 79, I find that 2 + 19 + 79 equals 100. This combination works perfectly.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

**Step 1: Understand Prime Numbers**
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- The smallest prime number is 2, which is the only even prime number.

**Step 2: Consider the Parity of the Sum**
- The sum of three odd numbers is odd (since \( odd + odd + odd = odd \)).
- Since 100 is even, we need to include the only even prime number, **2**, in our set to achieve an even sum.

**Step 3: Find Two Prime Numbers That Add Up to 98**
- We need to find two prime numbers (\( p \) and \( q \)) such that:
  \[
  2 + p + q = 100 \implies p + q = 98
  \]
- Let's look for pairs of prime numbers that add up to 98.

**Step 4: Identify Prime Pairs That Sum to 98**
- **Pair 1:** \( p = 19 \) and \( q = 79 \)
  \[
  19 + 79 = 98
  \]
  - Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers.
  
**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
- Adding all three numbers:
  \[
  2 + 19 + 79 = 100
  \]
- All three numbers are prime.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by considering the properties of prime numbers. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. 

Next, I'll think about the possible combinations of three prime numbers. Since even prime numbers are only 2, any set of three primes that adds up to an even number like 100 must include 2. This is because the sum of three odd numbers would be odd, and adding 2 (the only even prime) makes the total even.

Now, I'll subtract 2 from 100, resulting in 98. This means I need two prime numbers that add up to 98. 

I'll list the prime numbers less than 98 and look for pairs that sum to 98. By checking these pairs, I'll find that 23 and 75 work because both are prime numbers. 

Finally, I'll confirm that all three numbers (2, 23, and 75) are prime and that their sum is indeed 100.

**Solution:**

We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) such that:
\[
p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
\]

**Step 1: Understand the Properties of Prime Numbers**

- **Prime Numbers:** These are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.
- **Even Prime Number:** The only even prime number is 2, as any other even number is divisible by 2.

**Step 2: Identify the Role of the Even Prime (2)**

Since the sum of three odd numbers (which are all prime except for 2) will be odd, and 100 is even, **one of the primes must be 2**. This is because:
\[
\text{Even} = \text{Odd} + \text{Odd} + 2
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Sum**

Subtract 2 from 100 to find the sum of the other two primes:
\[
p_2 + p_3 = 100 - 2 = 98
\]

**Step 4: Find Prime Pairs that Sum to 98**

We need to find two prime numbers that add up to 98.

- List of primes less than 98: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
- **Look for pairs that sum to 98:**
  - **3 + 95:** 95 is **not prime** (divisible by 5 and 19).
  - **5 + 93:** 93 is **not prime** (divisible by 3 and 31).
  - **7 + 91:** 91 is **not prime** (divisible by 7 and 13).
  - **11 + 87:** 87 is **not prime** (divisible by 3 and 29).
  - **13 + 85:** 85 is **not prime** (divisible by 5 and 17).
  - **17 + 81:** 81 is **not prime** (divisible by 3 and 9).
  - **19 + 79:** Both are prime numbers.
  
**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

The three prime numbers are:
- \( p_1 = 2 \)
- \( p_2 = 19 \)
- \( p_3 = 79 \)

Verify the sum:
\[
2 + 19 + 79 = 100
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]
