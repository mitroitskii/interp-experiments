<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100.

I'll start by considering the smallest prime number, which is 2. If I include 2 in the set, the remaining two primes must add up to 98.

Next, I'll look for pairs of primes that sum to 98. The prime number 3 is the next smallest prime. If I subtract 3 from 98, I get 95. However, 95 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.

I'll move to the next prime number, which is 5. Subtracting 5 from 98 gives me 93. Similarly, 93 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, I'll test the next prime numbers: 7, 11, and 13. None of these result in a prime number when subtracted from 98.

Since none of the combinations with 2 and the next few primes work, I'll try using the next smallest prime, which is 3. If I include 3 in the set, the remaining two primes must add up to 97.

I'll start by selecting the prime number 5. Subtracting 5 from 97 gives me 92, which is not a prime number.

Next, I'll try 7. Subtracting 7 from 97 results in 90, which is also not a prime number.

Continuing this method, I'll test 11, 13, and 17. None of these combinations yield a prime number when subtracted from 97.

Finally, I'll try using the next prime number, 5, and select another prime number to complete the sum. Testing different combinations, I find that the primes 3, 5, and 89 add up to 97, which is not equal to 100.

After exhausting all possible combinations, I realize that there are no three prime numbers that add up to 100.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's systematically explore possible combinations.

**Step 1: Consider the smallest prime number, 2.**

If we include 2 in the set:
\[
2 + p + q = 100 \implies p + q = 98
\]
We need to find two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that their sum is 98.

**Step 2: Check for pairs of primes that sum to 98.**

- **Pair 1:** \( 3 + 95 = 98 \)  
  95 is **not** a prime number (divisible by 5).

- **Pair 2:** \( 5 + 93 = 98 \)  
  93 is **not** a prime number (divisible by 3).

- **Pair 3:** \( 7 + 91 = 98 \)  
  91 is **not** a prime number (divisible by 7 and 13).

- **Pair 4:** \( 11 + 87 = 98 \)  
  87 is **not** a prime number (divisible by 3).

- **Pair 5:** \( 13 + 85 = 98 \)  
  85 is **not** a prime number (divisible by 5).

- **Pair 6:** \( 17 + 81 = 98 \)  
  81 is **not** a prime number (divisible by 3).

- **Pair 7:** \( 19 + 79 = 98 \)  
  Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers.

**Step 3: Verify the combination.**
\[
2 + 19 + 79 = 100
\]
Indeed, \( 2 + 19 + 79 = 100 \), and all three numbers are prime.

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100.

Let me start by understanding that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

I'll denote the three prime numbers as \( p \), \( q \), and \( r \). So, the equation to solve is \( p + q + r = 100 \).

To simplify, I can express one of the primes in terms of the others. Let's say \( r = 100 - p - q \).

Next, I'll consider small prime numbers and see how they fit into the equation.

Let's try \( p = 3 \) (the smallest prime). Then \( q + r = 97 \).

Since 97 is also a prime, one of \( q \) or \( r \) must be 2 (the only even prime). Let's set \( q = 2 \), which gives \( r = 95 \). But 95 is not a prime number because it's divisible by 5. Therefore, this combination doesn't work.

Let's try \( p = 5 \). Then \( q + r = 95 \). Again, since 95 is an odd number, one of \( q \) or \( r \) must be 2. Setting \( q = 2 \) gives \( r = 93 \). However, 93 is not a prime number.

Now, let's set \( p = 7 \). Then \( q + r = 93 \). Choosing \( q = 2 \) leads to \( r = 91 \), which is not prime. Trying \( q = 3 \) gives \( r = 90 \), but 90 is not prime either.

Trying \( p = 11 \), we have \( q + r = 89 \). Setting \( q = 2 \) gives \( r = 87 \), which is not prime. Similarly, \( q = 3 \) results in \( r = 86 \), which is also not prime.

Moving on to \( p = 13 \), we get \( q + r = 87 \). Setting \( q = 2 \) gives \( r = 85 \), not prime. Trying \( q = 3 \) results in \( r = 84 \), which is not prime either.

Let's try \( p = 17 \), so \( q + r = 83 \). Setting \( q = 2 \) gives \( r = 81 \), not prime. Trying \( q = 3 \) results in \( r = 80 \), which is also not prime.

Now, let's attempt \( p = 19 \). This gives \( q + r = 81 \). Setting \( q = 2 \) gives \( r = 79 \), which is a prime number. Therefore, one valid combination is \( 19 + 2 + 79 = 100 \).

Finally, I'll check if there are other combinations, but I'll verify that this set of primes fits the required sum. Since 19, 2, and 79 are all primes and they add up to 100, this satisfies the condition.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Understanding Prime Numbers
A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and so on.

### Setting Up the Equation
We need to find three prime numbers \( p \), \( q \), and \( r \) such that:
\[ p + q + r = 100 \]

### Exploring Possible Combinations
Let's start by selecting small prime numbers for \( p \) and \( q \), then determine if \( r \) is also a prime.

1. **Let \( p = 3 \):**
   \[ q + r = 97 \]
   - Try \( q = 2 \) (the smallest prime):
     \[ r = 97 - 2 = 95 \]
     **95** is **not** a prime number (since \( 95 = 5 \times 19 \)).

2. **Let \( p = 5 \):**
   \[ q + r = 95 \]
   - Try \( q = 2 \):
     \[ r = 95 - 2 = 93 \]
     **93** is **not** a prime number (since \( 93 = 3 \times 31 \)).

3. **Let \( p = 7 \):**
