<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.

First, I remember that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. That means if I'm adding three primes together, the sum will depend on how many even primes are involved. Since 2 is the only even prime, including it might help in reaching an even total like 100. If I include 2, then the other two primes need to add up to 98 because 100 - 2 = 98. Now, 98 is an even number, and since the sum of two odd numbers is even, that's possible.

So, let me note that down. If I include 2, then I need two primes that add up to 98. Let's call them p and q, so p + q = 98. Both p and q need to be primes. Since 98 is an even number, and as I thought earlier, adding two odd numbers will give an even sum, that works.

Now, I need to find two primes that add up to 98. Let's list some primes less than 98 and see if any pair adds up to 98. Maybe starting from the lower primes and moving up.

Starting with 3: 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 a prime? Hmm, 95 divided by 5 is 19, so 95 is 5 × 19, which means it's not prime.

Next, 5: 98 - 5 = 93. Is 93 prime? 93 divided by 3 is 31, so 93 is 3 × 31, not prime.

Next prime is 7: 98 - 7 = 91. Is 91 prime? Hmm, 91 divided by 7 is 13, so 91 is 7 × 13, not prime.

Next, 11: 98 - 11 = 87. Is 87 prime? 87 divided by 3 is 29, so 87 is 3 × 29, not prime.

Next, 13: 98 - 13 = 85. 85 divided by 5 is 17, so 85 is not prime.

17: 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9 squared, so not prime.

19: 98 - 19 = 79. Hmm, is 79 a prime? Let me think. 79 is only divisible by 1 and itself. Let me check divisibility by primes less than sqrt(79), which is about 8.9. So, primes up to 7. 79 divided by 2? No. 3? 79/3 is about 26.3, not integer. 5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7? 7×11 is 77, 7×12 is 84, so no. So, 79 is a prime. Great! So, 19 and 79 are both primes, and they add up to 98.

So, putting it all together, the three primes are 2, 19, and 79. Let me check: 2 + 19 is 21, 21 + 79 is 100. Perfect! So, that works.

Wait, but just to make sure there are no other combinations, maybe I should check a few more primes to see if there are other pairs that add up to 98. Let's see.

Next prime after 19 is 23: 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5, so not prime.

29: 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is divisible by 3, so not prime.

31: 98 - 31 = 67. Is 67 prime? Let's check. 67 divided by 2? No. 3? 67/3 is about 22.3, nope. 5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7? 7×9 is 63, 7×10 is 70, so no. 11? 11×6 is 66, 11×7 is 77, so no. So, 67 is prime. So, 31 and 67 are primes that add up to 98. So, another combination is 2, 31, and 67. Let's check: 2 + 31 = 33, 33 + 67 = 100

Alright, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, examples of primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.

First off, I remember that except for the prime number 2, all other primes are odd. That might be useful because the sum of three odd numbers would be odd. But 100 is an even number. So, how can we get an even sum from three numbers? Well, if all three were odd, that would be odd + odd + odd = odd + odd = even; wait, no, hold on. Let me correct that. Actually, odd + odd = even, and then even + odd = odd. So, odd + odd + odd = odd. But we need the sum to be even, specifically 100.

So, that means we can’t have all three primes being odd because three odds add up to an odd number. Therefore, to get an even sum, we must have an even number of odd primes in our triplet. Since 2 is the only even prime, maybe one of the primes should be 2, and the other two would be odd primes. Let me verify that.

If we have two odd primes and one even prime (which is 2), then the sum would be odd + odd + even = even. That makes sense. So, that gives me a direction: one of the three primes is 2, and the other two need to add up to 98, because 100 - 2 = 98. Now, the problem reduces to finding two primes that add up to 98.

Hmm, okay. So, I need two primes that sum to 98. Let me think about what primes can make 98. Let's denote the two primes as p and q, such that p + q = 98.

I can start by checking small prime numbers and see if their complement (98 - prime) is also prime.

Let me list down some primes less than 98: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Wait, 97 is a prime less than 98, so I should include that.

Now, let me try subtracting each prime from 98 and see if the result is also prime.

Starting with the smallest prime, 2: 98 - 2 = 96. Is 96 prime? No, 96 is divisible by 2, 3, etc. So, 96 is not prime.

Next prime: 3. 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 prime? 95 ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5, not prime.

Next: 5. 98 - 5 = 93. Is 93 prime? 93 is divisible by 3 (9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3), so 93 is not prime.

Next: 7. 98 - 7 = 91. Is 91 prime? Hmm, 91 is 7 times 13, so no, not prime.

Next: 11. 98 - 11 = 87. Is 87 prime? 8 + 7 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so 87 is not prime.

Next: 13. 98 - 13 = 85. Is 85 prime? 85 is 5 times 17, so no, not prime.

Next: 17. 98 - 17 = 81. Is 81 prime? No, 81 is 9 times 9, so it's not prime.

Next: 19. 98 - 19 = 79. Is 79 prime? Yes! 79 is a prime number. So, 19 and 79 are both primes, and their sum is 98. Perfect!

So, going back to the original problem, if we take 2, 19, and 79, their sum is 2 + 19 + 79 = 100. Let me verify that again:

2 is a prime number. 19 is a prime number, and 79 is also a prime number. So, yes, that should work.

Just to make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities, let me continue checking a few more primes.

Next prime after 19 is 23.

Wait, but just to make sure there are no other combinations, maybe I should check a few more primes to see if there are other pairs that add up to 98. Let's see.

Next prime after 19 is 23: 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5, so not prime.

29: 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is divisible by 3, so not prime.
