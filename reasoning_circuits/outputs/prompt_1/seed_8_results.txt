<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. To start, I'll list out all the prime numbers less than 100. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Once I have the list of prime numbers, I'll look for combinations of three primes that sum to 100. I'll begin by considering the smallest prime, 2, as one of the numbers. This will leave me with finding two other primes that add up to 98. I'll check if 98 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. 

If 2 is not part of the solution, I'll move on to the next smallest prime, 3, and repeat the process. I'll continue this methodically until I find a valid combination of three primes that total 100.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The prime numbers less than 100 are:
     \[
     2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
     \]

2. **Find Combinations of Three Primes That Sum to 100:**
   - **Using the Prime Number 2:**
     - If we include 2, we need two more primes that add up to \(100 - 2 = 98\).
     - Check if 98 can be expressed as the sum of two primes:
       - \(98 = 19 + 79\) (Both 19 and 79 are primes)
     - **Solution Found:**
       \[
       2 + 19 + 79 = 100
       \]
   
   - **Verification:**
     - **2 is prime.**
     - **19 is prime.**
     - **79 is prime.**
     - **Sum: \(2 + 19 + 79 = 100\)**
   
   - **Other Combinations:**
     - If you're looking for other sets, you can explore them, but the simplest solution is \(2, 19, 79\).

3. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
   \]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify three prime numbers that add up to 100. To make this easier, I'll start by considering that the largest prime number in the trio is typically near 100, but since we're adding three numbers, it should be slightly smaller.

Let me try 89 as the largest possible prime. Now, I have to find two other primes that, when added to 89, total 100. This means the sum of the two smaller primes should be 11. I'll list the prime numbers less than 11: 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Next, I'll try pairing these primes to see which combination adds up to 11. Starting with the smallest prime, 2, if I pair it with 9, but 9 is not a prime number. Moving on, pairing 3 with 8 also doesn't work since 8 isn't prime. The next combination is 5 and 6, but again, 6 isn't prime. Finally, pairing 7 with 4 isn't valid either since 4 isn't a prime.

It seems like none of these pairs work, so I'll move to the next possible largest prime number, which is 83. If I take 83 as the largest prime, I need the sum of the other two primes to be 17. Let's list the primes less than 17: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

I'll start by pairing 2 with 15, but 15 isn't prime. Then, 3 and 14 also doesn't work. Next, 5 and 12 isn't valid, followed by 7 and 10, which also doesn't work. Trying 11 and 6, again, 6 isn't prime. Finally, pairing 13 with 4 isn't possible either. It looks like I can't find two primes that add up to 17 to go with 83.

I'll continue this process with the next largest prime, which is 79. The remaining sum needed is 21. Checking the primes less than 21: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.

Pairing 2 with 19 gives me 21. Checking if both are prime: 2 is prime and 19 is also prime. Perfect! So, the three primes are 2, 19, and 79.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
     \[
     p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
     \]
   
2. **Identify Potential Primes:**
   - Start by listing prime numbers less than 100.
   - Consider that the largest prime number in the trio will likely be near 100, so start checking from the higher end.

3. **Trial and Error:**
   - **First Attempt:**
     - Let's try \( p_3 = 97 \) (a prime number close to 100).
     - Then, \( p_1 + p_2 = 100 - 97 = 3 \).
     - The only primes that add up to 3 are \( 2 \) and \( 1 \), but \( 1 \) is not a prime number. So, this combination doesn't work.
   
   - **Second Attempt:**
     - Try \( p_3 = 89 \) (another prime near 100).
     - Then, \( p_1 + p_2 = 100 - 89 = 11 \).
     - Possible prime pairs:
       - \( 2 + 9 \) → 9 is not prime.
       - \( 3 + 8 \) → 8 is not prime.
       - \( 5 + 6 \) → 6 is not prime.
       - \( 7 + 4 \) → 4 is not prime.
     - No valid prime pairs here.
   
   - **Third Attempt:**
     - Let's try \( p_3 = 79 \).
     - Then, \( p_1 + p_2 = 100 - 79 = 21 \).
     - Possible prime pairs:
       - \( 2 + 19 \) → Both are primes.
     - Bingo! The primes \( 2, 19, \) and \( 79 \) add up to 100.

4. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
   \]
