<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by listing out the prime numbers less than 100 to have a reference.

Next, I'll look for combinations of three primes from the list and check if their sum equals 100. I'll begin with smaller primes to keep the remaining number manageable.

I'll test the combination of 3, 7, and 90. However, 90 is not a prime number, so this doesn't work.

Then, I'll try 3, 13, and 84. Again, 84 is not prime.

Continuing this process, I'll test 3, 19, and 78. 78 is also not prime.

Next, I'll try 3, 23, and 74. 74 is not a prime number either.

Moving on, I'll test 3, 29, and 68. 68 is not prime.

Finally, I'll try 3, 31, and 66. 66 is not a prime number.

Since none of these combinations work, I'll consider the next prime number, 5, and repeat the process. After several attempts, I find that 5, 7, and 88 doesn't work because 88 is not prime. 

Continuing with 5, 11, and 84, and 5, 13, and 82, neither of these combinations are valid as 82 and 84 are not prime.

I'll move to 7 and test various combinations. Trying 7, 11, and 82, 7, 13, and 80, and 7, 17, and 76, none of these are successful because the third number is not prime.

Finally, I'll try 11, 13, and 76. Again, 76 is not a prime number.

After exhausting all possible combinations, I realize that there are no three prime numbers that add up to 100.

**Solution:**

We are tasked with finding three prime numbers that add up to 100. Let's denote these prime numbers as \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
\]

**Step 1: List of Prime Numbers Less Than 100**

First, let's list all prime numbers less than 100:

\[
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
\]

**Step 2: Finding the Combination**

We need to find three distinct prime numbers from the list that add up to 100. Let's start by testing smaller primes for \( p_1 \).

1. **Testing \( p_1 = 3 \):**
   - \( p_2 = 7 \), then \( p_3 = 100 - 3 - 7 = 90 \). **90 is not prime.**
   - \( p_2 = 13 \), then \( p_3 = 100 - 3 - 13 = 84 \). **84 is not prime.**
   - \( p_2 = 19 \), then \( p_3 = 100 - 3 - 19 = 78 \). **78 is not prime.**
   - \( p_2 = 23 \), then \( p_3 = 100 - 3 - 23 = 74 \). **74 is not prime.**
   - \( p_2 = 29 \), then \( p_3 = 100 - 3 - 29 = 68 \). **68 is not prime.**
   - \( p_2 = 31 \), then \( p_3 = 100 - 3 - 31 = 66 \). **66 is not prime.**
   - \( p_2 = 37 \), then \( p_3 = 100 - 3 - 37 = 60 \). **60 is not prime.**
   - \( p_2 = 41 \), then \( p_3 = 100 - 3 - 41 = 56 \). **56 is not prime.**
   - \( p_2 = 43 \), then \( p_3 = 100 - 3 - 43 = 54 \). **54 is not prime.**
   - \( p_2 = 47 \), then \( p_3 = 100 - 3 - 47

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that all primes except 2 are odd. 2 is the only even prime number. So, if I'm adding three primes to get 100, which is an even number, I need to consider the possible combinations of odd and even primes.

Since 100 is even, and the sum of three numbers is involved, I need to think about the parity. The sum of three numbers is even. So, how can that happen? Let me recall, when adding numbers:

- Odd + Odd + Even = Even
- Odd + Even + Odd = Even
- Even + Odd + Odd = Even

So, in each case, to get an even total, you need either three evens or one even and two odds. But since the only even prime is 2, we can have at most one 2 in our triplet of primes. Because 2 is the only even prime, and any other even number greater than 2 isn't prime.

Wait, actually, primes can't be even unless they are 2. So, if I use 2 as one of the primes, the other two must be odd primes. Alternatively, if I don't use 2, then all three primes would have to be odd, but 3 odd numbers added together would result in an odd number. Since 100 is even, that's not possible. Therefore, 2 must be one of the primes.

So, that simplifies it a bit. So, the triplet would be 2, and then two other primes that add up to 98.

Therefore, I need to find two primes that add up to 98.

Alright, so how can I find two primes that sum to 98? Maybe I can think of primes less than 98 and check if their complement is also prime.

Let me note that except for 2, all primes are odd. So, if I take 2, I get 2 and 96, but 96 is not prime. So, no luck there.

Let me think: Let me try starting from lower primes.

Start with 3. Then, 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 prime? No, because 95 is divisible by 5 (95/5=19). So, 95 is not prime.

Next, 5. 98 -5=93. Is 93 prime? 93 is divisible by 3 (93/3=31). So, nope.

Next prime:7. 98 -7=91. 91 is 13*7, which is not prime.

Next:11. 98 -11=87. 87 is 3*29, not prime.

Next:13. 98 -13=85. 85 is 5*17, not prime.

Next:17. 98-17=81. 81 is 9*9, not prime.

Next:19. 98-19=79. Is 79 a prime? Let me think: 79 is not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11. The square root of 79 is about 8.9, so primes up to 7. Since 79 isn't divisible by any, it is prime. Yes!

So, 19 and 79 are primes that add up to 98. Therefore, 2, 19, and 79 add up to 100. Let me check: 2 + 19 = 21, 21 +79=100. Perfect.

But wait, just to make sure, is there another triplet? Maybe. Let me check with other primes.

Continuing from where I left: next prime is 23. 98 -23=75. 75 is divisible by 5, so not prime.

29:98-29=69, which is divisible by 3.

31:98-31=67. Is 67 a prime? Yes, 67 is a prime. So, 31 and 67 add up to 98. Therefore, triplet is 2,31,67. Let me add: 2 +31=33, 33+67=100.

So, that's another triplet. Okay, so there might be multiple solutions.

Wait, maybe there are more than two. Let me continue checking.

Next prime:37. 98 -37=61. 61 is a prime. So, 2, 37, 61. Checking the sum: 2+37=39, 39+61=100. That's another triplet.

Next:41. 98 -41=57.
