<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. That means if I have three primes adding up to 100, which is an even number, I probably need to consider the number of odd primes involved. Since 2 is the only even prime, maybe one of the primes can be 2, and the other two will have to add up to 98, which is an even number.

Let me write that down: 2 + p + q = 100, so p + q = 98. Now, since 98 is even, both p and q must be either both even or both odd. But the only even prime is 2, so if p and q are both even, one of them would have to be 2, but then the other would be 96, which isn't a prime because it's divisible by 2, 3, etc. So, that doesn't work. Therefore, both p and q must be odd primes.

So, we have two odd primes adding up to 98. The sum of two odd numbers is even, which works because 98 is even. Now, how do I find two primes that add up to 98?

I can try to list primes less than 98 and see which pairs add up to 98. Let me start with some primes: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Wait, 97 is a prime, but 97 + something would be 98? 97 + 1 = 98, but 1 isn't prime. So that doesn't work. Let me try the next one: 89. 89 + 9 = 98, but 9 isn't prime. Then 83: 83 + 15 = 98, 15 isn't prime. 79: 79 + 19 = 98. Ah, 19 is a prime! So, that gives us 79 and 19. Let me check: 79 is prime, 19 is prime, and 79 + 19 = 98. Perfect.

So, going back to the original equation: 2 + 79 + 19 = 100. Let me add them up: 2 + 79 is 81, and 81 + 19 is 100. Yep, that works. So, the three primes are 2, 19, and 79.

Wait, but are there other possible combinations? Maybe I should check if there are other pairs of primes that add up to 98. Let me try another one: 73. 73 + 25 = 98, but 25 isn't prime. 71: 71 + 27 = 98, 27 isn't prime. 67: 67 + 31 = 98. 31 is a prime! So, 67 and 31. Let me verify: 67 is prime, 31 is prime, and 67 + 31 = 98. So, adding up with 2: 2 + 67 + 31 = 100. That also works. So, another set is 2, 31, and 67.

Hmm, so there are multiple solutions. Let me see if I can find another one. Let's try 61: 61 + 37 = 98. Both 61 and 37 are primes. So, 2 + 61 + 37 = 100. That's another valid combination. So, 2, 37, 61.

Continuing, 59: 59 + 39 = 98, but 39 isn't prime. 53: 53 + 45 = 98, 45 isn't prime. 47: 47 + 51 = 98, 51 isn't prime. 43: 43 + 55 = 98, 55 isn't prime. 41: 41 + 57 = 98, 57 isn't prime. 37: already did that. 31: already did that. 29: 29 + 69 = 98, 69 isn't prime. 23: 23 + 75 = 98, 75 isn't prime. 19: already used that. 17: 17 + 81 = 98, 81

Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should recall that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. That might be useful because adding three odd numbers would result in an odd number, but 100 is even. So, if I add three primes, to get an even number like 100, maybe one of them has to be even. The only even prime number is 2. So, if one of the primes is 2, the other two primes must add up to 98.

Let me write that down: 2 + p + q = 100, so p + q = 98. Now, I need to find two prime numbers that add up to 98. Hmm, 98 is an even number as well. So, similar to earlier, except 2, all primes are odd. If I'm adding two primes to get an even number, it's likely both primes are odd. Let me verify that. If I have two odd numbers, they add up to an even number because odd + odd = even. If one was 2 and the other was 96, but 96 isn't a prime. So, yes, both p and q must be odd primes.

So, I can think that p and q are odd primes greater than 2, and they add to 98. I need to find such pairs. Maybe I can start by checking some primes less than 98 and see if their complement is also a prime.

Let me list some primes less than 50, as going up to 49 would pair with 49 to get 98, but 49 isn't prime. So, primes less than 50: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47. I'll try each one and see if 98 minus that prime is also a prime.

Starting with 3: 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 prime? Well, 95 is divisible by 5 (since it ends with a 5), so 95 = 5×19. Not prime.

Next, 5: 98 - 5 = 93. 93 is divisible by 3 (9+3=12, which is divisible by 3). So, 93=3×31. Not prime.

Next, 7: 98 - 7 = 91. 91 is 7×13. Not prime.

Moving to 11: 98 - 11 = 87. 87 is divisible by 3 (8+7=15), so 87=3×29. Not prime.

Next, 13: 98 - 13 = 85. 85 is 5×17. Not prime.

17: 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9×9, which is 3×27, so not prime.

19: 98 - 19 = 79. Hmm, is 79 a prime? Let me think. 79 is only divisible by 1 and itself. Checking divisibility up to sqrt(79) which is approximately 8.89. So, primes up to 7: 2, 3, 5, 7. 79 isn't even, doesn't end with 5, so not divisible by 2 or 5. 79/3 is about 26.33, so not divisible by 3. 79/7 is around 11.28, so not divisible by 7. Hence, 79 is prime. So, 19 and 79 are both primes and add up to 98.

Great, so that means the three primes are 2, 19, and 79. Let me verify: 2 + 19 = 21, 21 + 79 = 100. Yes, that works.

But just to be thorough, let me check other primes to ensure there aren't other pairs. Next prime after 19 is 23: 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is 15×5, not prime.

29: 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is 23×3, not prime.

31: 98 - 31 = 67. Is 67 prime? Yes, 67 is a prime number. Let me check: sqrt(67) is around 8.19, so check divisibility by primes up to 7. 67 isn't even, doesn't end with 5, 67/3 is about 22.
