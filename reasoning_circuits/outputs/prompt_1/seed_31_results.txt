<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100.

I'll start by listing the prime numbers less than 100 to have a reference.

Next, I'll consider that 100 is an even number, and since the sum of three odd numbers would be odd, one of the primes must be even. The only even prime number is 2.

So, one of the primes is 2. This leaves me with finding two primes that add up to 98.

I'll look for pairs of prime numbers that sum to 98. Starting with the smallest primes:

- 3 and 95: 95 is not prime.
- 5 and 93: 93 is not prime.
- 7 and 91: 91 is not prime.
- 11 and 87: 87 is not prime.
- 13 and 85: 85 is not prime.
- 17 and 81: 81 is not prime.
- 19 and 79: Both are prime.

So, the three prime numbers are 2, 19, and 79.

To find three prime numbers that add up to **100**, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
     \[
     p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
     \]
   - Remember that **2** is the only even prime number.

2. **Strategy:**
   - Since **100** is even and the sum of three odd numbers (primes) would be odd, one of the primes must be **2** (the only even prime).
   - This reduces the problem to finding two prime numbers that add up to **98**.

3. **Find Prime Pairs for 98:**
   - Start with smaller primes and check if their complement (98 - prime) is also prime.
   
   | Prime (\( p \)) | Complement (\( 98 - p \)) | Is Prime? |
   |------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
   | 3                | 95                       | No       |
   | 5                | 93                       | No       |
   | 7                | 91                       | No       |
   | 11               | 87                       | No       |
   | 13               | 85                       | No       |
   | 17               | 81                       | No       |
   | 19               | **79**                   | Yes      |
   
   - **Valid Pair:** 19 and 79.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The three prime numbers are **2**, **19**, and **79**.

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100.

I'll start by listing the prime numbers less than 100 to have a reference.

Next, I'll consider that 100 is an even number, and most prime numbers, except for 2, are odd. To get an even sum, one of the primes must be 2, and the other two must be odd primes.

So, I'll set 2 as one of the primes and work with the remaining sum of 98.

Now, I need to find two primes that add up to 98. These primes must both be odd, which makes sense since an odd plus an odd number equals an even number.

I'll systematically check pairs of primes until I find a valid pair that sums to 98.

After trying several combinations, I find that 23 and 75 are not primes. Continuing the search, I discover that 19 and 79 are both primes.

Finally, I verify that 2 + 19 + 79 equals 100, confirming that these three primes add up to 100.
</think>

**Solution:**

We need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Understand the Properties of Prime Numbers:**
   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.
   - Except for the prime number 2, all other primes are odd.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - **100 is an even number.**
   - To reach an even sum using odd numbers (most primes), we need to include the only even prime, which is **2**.
   - After selecting **2**, the remaining sum is **98**, which must be formed by two odd prime numbers.

3. **Identify Potential Prime Pairs:**
   - Start with the smallest prime greater than 2 (which is 3) and find another prime that complements it to 98.
   - **3 + 95:** 95 is **not** a prime (divisible by 5).
   - **5 + 93:** 93 is **not** a prime (divisible by 3).
   - **7 + 91:** 91 is **not** a prime (divisible by 7 and 13).
   - **11 + 87:** 87 is **not** a prime (divisible by 3).
   - **13 + 85:** 85 is **not** a prime (divisible by 5).
   - **17 + 81:** 81 is **not** a prime (divisible by 3).
   - **19 + 79:** **Both 19 and 79 are primes!**

4. **Final Check:**
   - Let's verify:
     \[
     2 + 19 + 79 = 100
     \]
   - All three numbers are primes.

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]
