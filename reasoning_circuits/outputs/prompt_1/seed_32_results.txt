<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Let me start by recalling that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

First, I'll consider the smallest prime number, which is 2. If I include 2 in the sum, the remaining two primes must add up to 98.

Next, I'll look for prime numbers that can add up to 98. Let's start with 3, the next smallest prime. Subtracting 3 from 98 gives 95, which is not a prime number.

Trying the next prime, 5, subtracting it from 98 gives 93, which is also not a prime number. Moving on to 7, subtracting it from 98 results in 91, which is not a prime number either.

Continuing this process, I'll test 11, which leaves 87 when subtracted from 98. 87 is not a prime number. Next, 13 subtracted from 98 gives 85, which is also not a prime number.

Trying 17, subtracting it from 98 results in 81, which is not a prime number. Moving on to 19, subtracting it from 98 gives 79. 79 is a prime number. Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 19, 79, and 2.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.
   - The smallest prime number is 2.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let the three prime numbers be \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \).
   - We need to find \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \).

3. **Start with the Smallest Prime:**
   - Since 2 is the smallest prime, let's try \( p_1 = 2 \).
   - This reduces the problem to finding two primes that add up to \( 100 - 2 = 98 \).

4. **Find Two Primes Adding to 98:**
   - Let's try the next smallest prime, 3.
     - \( 98 - 3 = 95 \) (95 is **not** a prime number)
   - Next, try 5.
     - \( 98 - 5 = 93 \) (93 is **not** a prime number)
   - Continue with 7.
     - \( 98 - 7 = 91 \) (91 is **not** a prime number)
   - Next, try 11.
     - \( 98 - 11 = 87 \) (87 is **not** a prime number)
   - Continue with 13.
     - \( 98 - 13 = 85 \) (85 is **not** a prime number)
   - Next, try 17.
     - \( 98 - 17 = 81 \) (81 is **not** a prime number)
   - Continue with 19.
     - \( 98 - 19 = 79 \) (79 **is** a prime number)

5. **Identify the Solution:**
   - The three prime numbers are \( 2 \), \( 19 \), and \( 79 \).

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Let me start by considering the properties of prime numbers, which are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Since the sum is even (100), I can use the fact that two odd primes and one even prime will work because the sum of two odd numbers is even, and adding another even number (which is 2) will make the total sum even. This means one of the primes should be 2.

So, I'll set one prime as 2. Now, the remaining sum to reach 100 is 98. I need to find two prime numbers that add up to 98.

Let me choose the next smallest prime, which is 3. Subtracting 3 from 98 gives me 95. Checking if 95 is a prime number, I find that it is not because it is divisible by 5. Therefore, 3 is not a suitable choice.

Next, I'll try the prime number 5. Subtracting 5 from 98 leaves me with 93. Checking if 93 is prime, I discover it's divisible by 3, so 5 doesn't work either.

Moving on, I'll try the prime number 7. Subtracting 7 from 98 gives me 91. Checking if 91 is prime, it turns out it's not because it's divisible by 7 and 13. So, 7 is also not suitable.

Continuing this process, I'll test the prime number 11. Subtracting 11 from 98 results in 87. However, 87 is divisible by 3, so it's not a prime number.

I'll try the next prime, 13. Subtracting 13 from 98 gives me 85. Checking if 85 is prime, I find that it's divisible by 5, so 13 doesn't work.

Next, testing the prime number 17. Subtracting 17 from 98 leaves me with 81. Checking if 81 is prime, it's not because it's divisible by 9. Therefore, 17 isn't the right choice.

Moving forward, I'll test the prime number 19. Subtracting 19 from 98 gives me 79. Checking if 79 is prime, I determine that it is. 

Finally, I've found that 2, 19, and 79 are all prime numbers and they add up to 100. I should double-check by adding them: 2 + 19 is 21, and 21 + 79 equals 100. Everything checks out.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Properties of Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Except for the prime number 2, all other prime numbers are odd.

2. **Consider the Parity of the Sum:**
   - The sum of three numbers will be **even (100)** in this case.
   - Since 2 is the only even prime, one of the primes must be 2 to maintain the even sum.

3. **Set One Prime as 2:**
   - Let's choose 2 as one of the primes.
   - This leaves us with the remaining sum: \(100 - 2 = 98\).

4. **Find Two More Prime Numbers Adding Up to 98:**
   - We'll search for two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( p + q = 98 \).

5. **Iterate Over Possible Primes:**
   - **Prime 3:** \(98 - 3 = 95\) (Not prime, since 95 is divisible by 5)
   - **Prime 5:** \(98 - 5 = 93\) (Not prime, since 93 is divisible by 3)
   - **Prime 7:** \(98 - 7 = 91\) (Not prime, since 91 is divisible by 7 and 13)
   - **Prime 11:** \(98 - 11 = 87\) (Not prime, since 87 is divisible by 3)
   - **Prime 13:** \(98 - 13 = 85\) (Not prime, since 85 is divisible by 5)
   - **Prime 17:** \(98 - 17 = 81\) (Not prime, since 81 is divisible by 9)
   - **Prime 19:** \(98 - 19 = 79\) (Prime)
   
6. **Confirm the Solution:**
   - The three primes are **2**, **19**, and **79**.
   - Adding them: \(2 +
