<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by listing some prime numbers that are less than 100, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.

Next, I'll consider the possibility of including the smallest prime number, 2, in the trio since it's the only even prime. This means the other two primes will need to add up to 98.

I'll look for two prime numbers that sum to 98. Trying 19 and 79, both of which are prime, I find that 19 + 79 equals 98.

Finally, adding the 2 to 19 and 79 gives me the three primes: 2, 19, and 79. Their sum is indeed 100.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
     \[
     p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
     \]
   - **Prime numbers** are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

2. **Consider the Smallest Prime:**
   - The smallest prime number is **2**. Since 2 is the only even prime, including it might simplify our search.

3. **Assume 2 as One of the Primes:**
   - Let \( p_1 = 2 \). Then:
     \[
     p_2 + p_3 = 100 - 2 = 98
     \]
   - Now, we need to find two prime numbers that add up to **98**.

4. **Find Prime Pairs Adding to 98:**
   - We'll look for primes \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) such that \( p_2 + p_3 = 98 \).
   - **Example Pair:** \( 19 \) and \( 79 \) are both primes, and:
     \[
     19 + 79 = 98
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Adding all three primes:
     \[
     2 + 19 + 79 = 100
     \]
   - All three numbers are prime, and their sum is indeed 100.

6. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
   \]

First, I need to identify three prime numbers that add up to 100. Let me start by recalling that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

I'll begin by listing out the prime numbers less than 100 and see which combinations could sum up to 100. Starting with the smallest prime, 2, since it's the only even prime number.

Next, I'll consider combinations involving 3, the next prime number, and see if there are two other primes that, when added together, equal 97 (100 minus 3).

If I try 3 and 97, adding those gives me 100, but 97 is a prime number. Wait, that means 3, 3, and 94 would add up to 100, but 94 is not prime. I need to look for other combinations.

Trying with 5, one of the smallest primes, and searching for two other primes that sum up to 95. However, 5 and 95 doesn't work because 95 isn't prime. Let's try 5 and 93, but 93 is also not prime.

Moving on to 7, I'll check if 7 and 93 add up, but again, 93 isn't a prime. Trying 7 and 91, which also isn't prime. It seems 7 isn't the right choice.

Now, let's try using 11. Subtracting 11 from 100 gives me 89. Is 89 a prime number? Yes, it is. That means 11, 11, and 78 add up to 100. But 78 isn't prime. I need to adjust.

Let me try 11 and 13. 11 plus 13 is 24, so I need two primes that add up to 76. Looking for primes like 13 and 61, which would make the total 11 + 13 + 61 = 85, which is too low. Maybe 11 + 17 + 17 = 45, still not enough.

I should try a larger prime first. Let's take 17. 100 minus 17 is 83. Is 83 a prime? Yes, it is. So, 17 + 17 + 66 is too low, so that doesn't work.

Let me see if I can use 19. 100 minus 19 is 81, which isn't prime. Maybe 19 and 19: 19 + 19 = 38, so I'd need two primes that add up to 62. Looking for primes like 19 and 43, which would give me 19 + 19 + 43 = 81, not enough.

Trying with 23. 100 minus 23 is 77. 77 isn't prime, so that doesn't work. 23 + 23 = 46, so I need two primes that add up to 54. Primes like 23 and 31 would make 54, but adding them to 23 gives 23 + 23 + 31 = 77, still too low.

I'll try 29. 100 minus 29 is 71, which is a prime. So, 29 + 29 + 42 isn't valid since 42 isn't prime. Alternatively, 29 + 31 + 40 doesn't work either.

Moving on to 31. 100 minus 31 is 69. 69 isn't prime. Trying two 31s: 31 + 31 = 62, so I need two primes that add up to 38. Primes like 31 and 7 would do, but 31 + 31 + 7 = 69, which is not 100.

Next, 37. 100 minus 37 is 63, which isn't prime. Trying two 37s: 37 + 37 = 74, needing two primes to add up to 26. Possible primes like 13 and 13, making the total 37 + 37 + 13 + 13 = 100, but that's four numbers.

Wait, I need three primes. So, let me see if I can find a triplet. What about 37 + 37 + 26? 26 isn't prime. Alternatively, 37 + 19 + 44 is too much.

Perhaps 43. 100 minus 43 is 57, which isn't prime. Trying two 43s: 43 + 43 = 86, so I need two primes that add up to 14. 7 and 7, so 43 + 43 + 7 + 7 = 100, but that's four numbers again.

Let me try another approach. Maybe a prime in the middle and two others.
