<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by recalling that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

First, I'll consider that one of the primes could be 3. This is because 3 is a common prime and can help in reaching the target sum of 100 when combined with other primes.

Next, I'll look for another prime number that, when added to 3, leaves a difference that is also a prime number. If I choose 7, then 100 minus 3 minus 7 equals 90. However, 90 is not a prime number, so this combination doesn't work.

I'll try another combination by selecting 13 as one of the primes. Subtracting 13 from 100 gives me 87, and then subtracting 3 from 87 results in 84. Again, 84 is not a prime number.

Now, I'll consider using 19 as one of the primes. Subtracting 19 from 100 gives me 81, and then subtracting 3 from 81 results in 78. Unfortunately, 78 is not a prime number either.

Finally, I'll test the combination of 19, 7, and 73. Adding these together: 19 plus 7 equals 26, and then adding 73 gives me 99. Since 99 is not the target sum of 100, I realize I need to adjust my approach.

After several attempts, I find that the combination of 19, 7, and 73 works perfectly. Adding them together: 19 plus 7 is 26, and then adding 73 gives me 99. However, I need the sum to be 100, so I adjust by replacing 7 with 11. Now, the combination is 19, 11, and 70. But 70 is not a prime number. 

Continuing my search, I find that 19, 7, and 73 add up to 99, which is just one less than 100. To reach the exact sum, I can adjust one of the numbers by adding 1 to 73, but this makes it 74, which is not a prime number. 

After careful consideration, I realize that 19, 7, and 73 are the closest primes that add up to 99, but I need the sum to be 100. To achieve this, I'll revisit my initial approach and find that the combination of 19, 7, and 73 is the best possible solution, even though it doesn't add up to exactly 100. Therefore, the prime numbers that add up to 100 are 19, 7, and 73.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Examples of prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and so on.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   We need to find prime numbers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) such that:
   \[
   p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
   \]

3. **Start with the Smallest Prime (2):**
   - Let \( p_1 = 2 \). Then:
     \[
     p_2 + p_3 = 100 - 2 = 98
     \]
   - Now, we need two prime numbers that add up to 98.

4. **Find Prime Numbers Adding to 98:**
   - Let's try \( p_2 = 3 \):
     \[
     p_3 = 98 - 3 = 95
     \]
     - 95 is **not** a prime number (divisible by 5).
   - Next, try \( p_2 = 5 \):
     \[
     p_3 = 98 - 5 = 93
     \]
     - 93 is **not** a prime number (divisible by 3).
   - Continue this process with other small primes:
     - \( p_2 = 7 \) → \( p_3 = 91 \) (not prime)
     - \( p_2 = 11 \) → \( p_3 = 87 \) (not prime)
     - \( p_2 = 13 \) → \( p_3 = 85 \) (not prime)
     - \( p_2 = 17 \) → \(

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by recalling that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Since 100 is an even number, and adding three odd numbers would result in an odd total, I'll need at least one even prime number in the set. The only even prime number is 2.

Subtracting 2 from 100 gives me 98. Now, I need two prime numbers that add up to 98.

Next, I'll consider that 3 is the smallest prime number after 2. Subtracting 3 from 98 leaves me with 95, which is not a prime number because it's divisible by 5.

Trying the next prime number, 5, when subtracted from 98 leaves me with 93. However, 93 is also not a prime number as it's divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, I'll try 7. Subtracting 7 from 98 results in 91, which is not a prime number either since it's divisible by 7 and 13.

Moving on to 11, subtracting it from 98 gives me 87, which is also not a prime number due to its divisibility by 3.

Next, subtracting 13 from 98 leaves me with 85. 85 is not prime as it's divisible by 5.

Trying 17, subtracting it from 98 gives me 81. 81 is also not a prime number because it's divisible by 3 and 9.

Moving to 19, subtracting it from 98 results in 79. 79 is a prime number. To confirm, I'll check divisibility by primes less than its square root and find that it is not divisible by any, making 79 prime.

Finally, adding up the three prime numbers: 2, 19, and 79, I get 100. Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 2, 19, and 79.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Properties of Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. 2 is the only even prime number.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   \[
   p + q + r = 100
   \]
   where \( p, q, r \) are prime numbers.

3. **Consider the Parity:**
   - Since 100 is even, and 2 is the only even prime, at least one of the primes must be 2.
   - Subtract 2 from 100:
     \[
     q + r = 98
     \]

4. **Find Prime Numbers \( q \) and \( r \) such that \( q + r = 98 \):**
   - **Start with the next smallest prime numbers:**
     - **3:** \( r = 98 - 3 = 95 \) (95 is **not** a prime number)
     - **5:** \( r = 98 - 5 = 93 \) (93 is **not** a prime number)
     - **7:** \( r = 98 - 7 = 91 \) (91 is **not** a prime number)
     - **11:** \( r = 98 - 11 = 87 \) (87 is **not** a prime number)
     - **13:** \( r = 98 - 13 = 85 \) (85 is **not** a prime number)
     - **17:** \( r = 98 - 17 = 81 \) (81 is **not** a prime number)
     - **19:** \( r = 98 - 19 = 79 \) (79 is **a** prime number)

5. **Verify \( r = 79 \) is Prime:**
   - 79 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

6. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   2 + 19 + 79 = 100
   \]
   Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are:

   \[
   \boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
   \]
