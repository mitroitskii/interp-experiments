<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. So, if I'm adding three primes, the sum could be odd or even depending on how many even primes are involved. Since 2 is the only even prime, having one even prime (which is 2) and two odd primes will result in an odd sum. Having three even primes isn't possible because there's only one even prime, which is 2.

Wait, but 100 is an even number. So, if I use 2 as one of the primes, then the other two primes must add up to 98, which is even. Since even numbers can be expressed as the sum of two odd numbers, that makes sense. If I don't use 2, then all three primes would have to be odd, and adding three odd numbers would give an odd sum, which can't be 100. So, definitely, one of the primes has to be 2.

So, let me write that down: one prime is 2, and the other two primes add up to 98. Now, I need to find two prime numbers that add up to 98. Hmm, 98 is an even number, so maybe I can express it as the sum of two primes. But wait, I remember something called the Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. So, 98 should be expressible as the sum of two primes. That gives me some hope.

Alright, so now I need to find pairs of primes that add up to 98. Let me think about how to approach this. I can start by checking if 98 minus a prime is also a prime. Let me list some primes less than 98 and see if subtracting them from 98 gives another prime.

Let me recall some primes around 98. The primes less than 98 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. Wait, 97 is a prime, but 98 - 97 is 1, which is not prime. So that doesn't work.

Let me try 89. 98 - 89 is 9. 9 is not prime. Next, 83. 98 - 83 is 15. 15 is not prime. 79. 98 - 79 is 19. 19 is a prime! So, 79 and 19 are primes, and they add up to 98. So, that gives me 2, 19, and 79. Let me check: 2 + 19 + 79 = 100. Yes, that works.

Wait, but I should make sure if there are other possibilities or if this is the only one. Let me see. Maybe I can find another pair. Let's continue.

73: 98 - 73 = 25, which is not prime. 71: 98 - 71 = 27, not prime. 67: 98 - 67 = 31, which is prime. So, 67 and 31 add up to 98. So, 2, 67, and 31. Let me check: 2 + 67 + 31 = 100. That also works.

Alright, so that's another set. Let me see if there are more.

61: 98 - 61 = 37, which is prime. So, 61 and 37. Then, 2, 61, 37. Adding up: 2 + 61 + 37 = 100. Yep, that's another one.

Continuing: 59: 98 - 59 = 39, not prime. 53: 98 - 53 = 45, not prime. 47: 98 - 47 = 51, not prime. 43: 98 - 43 = 55, not prime. 41: 98 - 41 = 57, not prime. 37: 98 - 37 = 61, which we already have. 31: 98 - 31 = 67, which we also have. 29: 98 - 29 = 69, not prime. 23: 98 - 23 = 75

Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few primes I know are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and so on. I guess I should start by thinking about the possible combinations of these primes that add up to 100.

First, I remember that all primes except for 2 are odd numbers. Since 2 is the only even prime, I wonder if using 2 in the combination will help me get to 100. Because if I use 2, then the other two primes have to add up to 98, which is even. Wait, but 98 is even, and if I add two odd numbers, the sum would be even as well. So maybe that's possible. On the other hand, if I don't use 2, then I need three odd primes, and their sum would be odd + odd + odd = odd + even = odd. But 100 is even, so three odd primes can't sum to 100. That means I must include the number 2 in my set of three primes.

So that gives me a starting point: one of the primes is 2, and the other two primes add up to 98. Now I need to find two prime numbers that add up to 98. Let's think about that.

Let me denote the three primes as 2, p, q, where p + q = 98. So I need p and q such that both are primes and p + q = 98. How do I approach this? Maybe I can list some primes less than 98 and see which ones pair up to 98.

But before I go into listing all primes, let me think if there's a smarter way. 98 is an even number, so as before, both p and q must be odd primes because 98 divided by 2 is 49, which is odd. So, p and q are both odd primes. Let me also remember that except for 2, all primes are odd, so this works.

Let me start by checking primes around 49 since 49 is the midpoint of 98. Let's check 43 and 55: 43 is prime, but 55 is not because 55 is divisible by 5 and 11. How about 47 and 51? 47 is prime, but 51 is not because 51 is divisible by 3 and 17. Hmm, okay, how about 53 and 45? 45 isn't prime. 59 and 39? 39 isn't prime. 61 and 37? Both are primes! So that's a pair: 61 and 37. Let me check 37 + 61: 37 + 61 is 98, yes.

So that gives me the primes 2, 37, and 61. Let me verify that they add up to 100: 2 + 37 is 39, and 39 + 61 is 100. Perfect.

Wait, but are there other combinations? Maybe I should check if there are more such primes or if there's another pair that adds up to 98.

Let me continue with this approach. If I pick a prime less than 49, then the other number needs to be a prime greater than 49. Let me try 13. 98 - 13 is 85. Is 85 a prime? 85 is divisible by 5 and 17, so no. Next prime: 17. 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is not a prime, it's 9 times 9. Next prime: 19. 98 - 19 = 79. Is 79 a prime? Yes, it is! So that gives me another combination: 2, 19, and 79. Let me check: 2 + 19 is 21, and 21 + 79 is 100. Nice, another set.

Let me try another prime: 23. 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5 and 15, so not a prime. Next, 29: 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is divisible by 3 and 23, not a prime. Next, 31: 98 - 31 = 67. 67 is a prime. So 2, 31, and 67. Checking: 2 + 31 is 33, plus 67 is 100. Perfect, another triplet.

Continuing: 37 again. 98 - 37 = 61. Wait, that
