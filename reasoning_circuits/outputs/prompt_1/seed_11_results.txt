<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First off, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the prime numbers start from 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. I remember that except for 2, all other prime numbers are odd. That might be useful because if I add three odd numbers together, the result will be odd. But 100 is an even number. So, to get an even sum from three numbers, at least one of them must be even. The only even prime number is 2. So, one of the primes has to be 2.

Alright, so let me write that down. Let the three primes be 2, p, and q. So, 2 + p + q = 100. That means p + q = 98. Now, I need to find two prime numbers that add up to 98.

Since p and q are primes, and they are both odd (because 2 is the only even prime), their sum will be even. 98 is even, so that works. Now, I need to find pairs of primes that add up to 98.

I can start by trying smaller primes and see if their complement is also a prime. Let me list some primes less than 98 and check.

Starting with 3: 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 a prime? Let me think. 95 is divisible by 5 because it ends with a 5. So, 95 is not prime.

Next, 5: 98 - 5 = 93. Is 93 prime? 93 divided by 3 is 31, so 93 is divisible by 3. Not prime.

Next, 7: 98 - 7 = 91. Is 91 prime? Hmm, 91 divided by 7 is 13, so 91 is 7 times 13. Not prime.

Moving on, 11: 98 - 11 = 87. Is 87 prime? 87 divided by 3 is 29, so 87 is not prime.

Next, 13: 98 - 13 = 85. 85 is divisible by 5, so not prime.

17: 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9 squared, so not prime.

19: 98 - 19 = 79. Hmm, is 79 a prime? Let me think. 79 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Let me check:

79 divided by 2 is not whole.
79 divided by 3 is 26.333...
79 divided by 5 is 15.8.
79 divided by 7 is about 11.285...
79 divided by 11 is about 7.181...
Next prime is 13: 79 divided by 13 is about 6.07, not whole.
17: 79/17 is about 4.647.
19: 79/19 is about 4.157.
So, 79 is a prime number.

Okay, so 19 and 79 are both primes, and 19 + 79 = 98. So, the three primes are 2, 19, and 79. Let me verify that: 2 + 19 + 79 = 100. Yep, that adds up.

Wait, before I conclude, let me check if there are other possible combinations. Maybe starting with 23: 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5, so not prime.

29: 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is divisible by 3, so not prime.

31: 98 - 31 = 67. Is 67 prime? Let me check. 67 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11. Let me see:

67 divided by 2: 33.5
67 divided by 3: 22.333...
67 divided by 5: 13.4
67 divided by 7: about 9.571
67 divided by 11: about 6.09
Next prime is 13: 67/13 ≈ 5.15, not whole.
17: 67/17 ≈ 3.94
19: 67/19 ≈ 3.526
So, 67 is prime. So, 31 and 67 are primes, and 31 + 67 = 98. So, the three primes are 2, 31, and 67.

Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, okay, primes. Let me remember, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, primes like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

First off, I know that 2 is the only even prime number. All other primes are odd. So, if I'm trying to add three numbers together to get 100, which is an even number, I have to think about how the parities will add up.

Let's recall that even plus even plus even is even, even plus even plus odd is odd, even plus odd plus odd is even, and odd plus odd plus odd is odd. So, since 100 is even, the combination of three primes must be either all even or two odds and one even.

But wait, 2 is the only even prime, so if we include 2, then the other two primes have to be odd primes. If we don't include 2, we need all three primes to be odd, but the sum of three odd numbers would be odd, which can't be 100 because it's even. So, we must include 2 as one of the primes.

So, now I know that one of the primes is 2, and the other two are odd primes. So, the equation I need to solve is 2 + p + q = 100, where p and q are odd primes. That simplifies to p + q = 98. So, I need two odd primes that add up to 98.

Since p and q are both odd, their sum, 98, is even, which is expected because adding two odd numbers gives an even number. So, how do I find such primes?

Maybe I can start by noting that primes, except for 2, are all odd. So, primes are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, etc. Maybe I can try some pairs and see if they add up to 98.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a problem of Goldbach partitions, where we express an even number as the sum of two primes. Although in this case, it's three primes, but since we have 2 already, it's like a Goldbach partition of 98 into two primes.

So, is 98 expressible as the sum of two primes? Let's see. If I can find two primes that add to 98, then I can have the three primes needed.

Let me think about possible primes less than 98.

Wait, maybe I can use some constraints. Since 98 is an even number, and the larger prime must be less than 98. Also, except for 2, all primes are odd, so adding two odd numbers will give an even sum, which is good.

Let me try to find two primes p and q such that p + q = 98.

Starting with the smaller primes.

If p = 3, then q = 95. Is 95 prime? 95 is 5 times 19, so no, it's not prime.

If p = 5, then q = 93. 93 is divisible by 3 (since 9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3), so no.

p = 7, q = 91. 91 is 7 times 13, so not prime.

p = 11, q = 87. 87 is 3 times 29, so not prime.

p = 13, q = 85. 85 is 5 times 17, not prime.

p = 17, q = 81. 81 is 9 squared, so no.

p = 19, q = 79. Hmm, 79 is a prime. So, 19 and 79 are both primes, so that works.

Let me check that: 19 + 79 = 98, and both are primes.

So, then, going back to the original problem, 2 + 19 + 79 = 100. So, that's a valid set: 2, 19, 79.

Wait, but before I jump to that conclusion, maybe there are other combinations as well.

Let me see. Let's continue from where I left off.

p = 23, then q = 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5, so not prime.

p = 29, q = 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is 3 times 23, not prime.

p = 31, q = 67. Both 31 and 67 are primes
