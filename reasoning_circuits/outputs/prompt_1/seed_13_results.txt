<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. So, if I'm adding three primes, I have to consider how many of them can be even. The only even prime number is 2, right? So, if I include 2, then the other two primes have to add up to 98. If I don't include 2, then all three primes are odd. But wait, adding three odd numbers together would give me an odd total because odd + odd + odd = odd. Since 100 is even, that means I can't have three odd primes adding up to 100. Therefore, one of the primes has to be 2, and the other two will add up to 98.

Okay, so now I just need to find two prime numbers that add up to 98. Let me list out some primes less than 98 and see which ones pair up to make 98.

Starting from the lower primes: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Wait, 97 is a prime, but 97 is already bigger than 98 when paired with another prime, so I can ignore that.

I can try 3 and 95. Hmm, is 95 prime? Let me check. 95 divided by 5 is 19, so no, 95 isn't prime.

Next, 5. So, 98 minus 5 is 93. Is 93 prime? 93 divided by 3 is 31, so nope, not prime.

Moving on to 7. 98 minus 7 is 91. Is 91 prime? Hmm, 91 divided by 7 is 13, so no, 91 isn't prime.

Next prime is 11. 98 minus 11 is 87. Is 87 prime? 87 divided by 3 is 29, so no, 87 isn't prime.

Next, 13. 98 minus 13 is 85. 85 divided by 5 is 17, so not prime.

17. 98 minus 17 is 81. 81 is 9 times 9, so not prime.

19. 98 minus 19 is 79. Is 79 prime? Yes, 79 is a prime number. So, 19 and 79 are both primes, and they add up to 98. Therefore, the three primes are 2, 19, and 79.

Wait, let me double-check: 2 + 19 + 79. 2 + 19 is 21, and 21 + 79 is 100. Yep, that works.

Just to make sure there aren't any other combinations, let me check the next few primes after 19.

23. 98 minus 23 is 75. 75 isn't prime because it's divisible by 5.

29. 98 minus 29 is 69. 69 divided by 3 is 23, so not prime.

31. 98 minus 31 is 67. Is 67 prime? Yes, 67 is a prime. So, 31 and 67 are primes. Let me add them up: 2 + 31 + 67. 2 + 31 is 33, and 33 + 67 is 100. Okay, that's another valid combination.

Hmm, so there are at least two sets of primes that add up to 100: 2, 19, 79 and 2, 31, 67. Are there more?

Continuing, 37. 98 minus 37 is 61. 61 is a prime. So, 2, 37, 61. Let's add them: 2 + 37 is 39, plus 61 is 100. That's another one.

43. 98 minus 43 is 55. 55 is 5 times 11, not prime.

47. 98 minus 47 is 51. 51 is 3 times 17, not prime.

53. 98 minus 53 is 45. 45 is divisible by 5 and 3, not prime.

59. 98 minus 59 is 39. 39 is 3 times 13, not prime.

61. 98 minus 61

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how I can approach this.

First, I know that primes are mostly odd numbers, except for 2, which is the only even prime. So, if I’m adding three primes to get 100, which is an even number, I need to consider how the evenness comes into play.

Let me recall that adding three odd numbers would give an odd total. For example, 3 + 5 + 7 = 15, which is odd. But 100 is even, so I can't have all three primes being odd. That means I need to have exactly one even prime in there. Since 2 is the only even prime, one of the primes has to be 2, right? Because that would make the other two primes odd, and their sum would be even (since odd + odd = even). So 2 + odd + odd = even + even = even, which would equal 100.

So, that simplifies things a bit. I can set one of the primes as 2 and then solve for the other two primes that add up to 98, since 100 - 2 = 98. So, now I need two primes that add up to 98. Let me think about that.

I can start by considering the properties of primes. Since primes are greater than 1, the smallest prime is 2, but in this case, since we've already used 2, the other two have to be at least 3. Now, let's list out some primes less than 98 and see which pairs add up to 98.

Let me start by checking if 98 minus each prime gives another prime. Starting from a lower prime:

First, let's try 3. 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 a prime? Hmm, 95 is divisible by 5 (since it ends with a 5), so no, 95 is not prime.

Next, 5. 98 - 5 = 93. Is 93 a prime? Let's check if it's divisible by any numbers. 93 divided by 3 is 31, so yes, 93 is divisible by 3, hence not prime.

Next, 7. 98 - 7 = 91. Is 91 prime? Hmm, 91 is 7 times 13, so no, it's not prime.

Next, 11. 98 - 11 = 87. 87 is divisible by 3 (since 8 + 7 = 15, which is divisible by 3), so nope.

Moving on, 13. 98 - 13 = 85. 85 ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5. Not prime.

17. 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9 times 9, which means it's not prime.

19. 98 - 19 = 79. Hmm, 79. Let me check if 79 is prime. 79 is a well-known prime number because it doesn't have any divisors other than 1 and itself. Let me double-check: 79 divided by 2 is 39.5, nope. Divided by 3 is about 26.333, not an integer. Divided by 5 is 15.8, nope. 7? 79 divided by 7 is about 11.285, nope. 11? 79 divided by 11 is 7.1818, still no. The square root of 79 is about 8.88, so I don't need to check beyond that. So 79 is prime. So that's a good pair: 19 and 79.

So, putting it all together, we have 2, 19, and 79. Let me check the sum: 2 + 19 = 21, and 21 + 79 = 100. Yep, that works.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any other possible pairs. Maybe there's another combination. Let's try a few more to ensure there isn't another triplet.

Continuing from where I left off:

23. 98 - 23 = 75. 75 ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5, not prime.

29. 98 - 29 = 69. 69 divided by 3 is 23, so it's not prime.

31. 98 - 31 = 67. 67 is a prime number. Let me confirm: 67 divided by 2 is not an integer, 3? 67
