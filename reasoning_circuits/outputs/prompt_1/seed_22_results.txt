<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Let me start by listing some prime numbers under 100. The prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

Since 2 is the only even prime number, one of the three primes in the sum must be 2. This leaves me with finding two more prime numbers that add up to 98. I'll go through the list and see which two primes sum to 98.

Let me try pairing 3 with 95. 95 is not prime because it's divisible by 5. Next, 5 plus 93—93 is divisible by 3, so that's not prime either. Trying 7 and 91: 91 is 7 multiplied by 13, so it's not prime. Moving on, 11 and 87: 87 is divisible by 3. Then 13 and 85: 85 is divisible by 5. 

Next, 17 and 81: 81 is 9 squared, so it's not prime. 19 and 79: Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers. That works! So the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 19, 7, and 86. Wait, no, 86 is not prime. I made a mistake there. Let me check again.

If 19 and 79 are both primes, their sum is 98. Adding the initial 2 gives a total of 100. So the correct primes are 2, 19, and 79.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \).
   - Remember that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Identify the Smallest Prime:**
   - The only even prime number is **2**. Including 2 in our sum will help because it allows us to work with odd numbers, which are more common among primes (except for 2).

3. **Calculate the Remaining Sum:**
   - If we include 2, the remaining sum is \( 100 - 2 = 98 \).
   - Now, we need to find two prime numbers that add up to **98**.

4. **Find Prime Pairs for 98:**
   - List some prime numbers less than 98: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.
   - Start testing pairs:
     - **3 + 95 = 98** → 95 is not prime (divisible by 5).
     - **5 + 93 = 98** → 93 is not prime (divisible by 3).
     - **7 + 91 = 98** → 91 is not prime (divisible by 7 and 13).
     - **11 + 87 = 98** → 87 is not prime (divisible by 3).
     - **13 + 85 = 98** → 85 is not prime (divisible by 5).
     - **17 + 81 = 98** → 81 is not prime (divisible by 9).
     - **19 + 79 = 98** → **Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers!**

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The three prime numbers that add up to 100 are **2**, **19**, and **79**.

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. 

First, I'll recall that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. 

Since the sum is even (100), and 2 is the only even prime number, I'll consider whether one of the primes is 2. If so, the remaining two primes will add up to 98. 

I'll then look for two prime numbers that add up to 98. Starting with 3, the next prime number, I'll check if both (98 - 3) and 3 are prime. However, 95 is not a prime number because it's divisible by 5. 

Next, I'll try 5. Then, 93 is not prime because it's divisible by 3. Moving on, with 7, 91 is not prime as it's divisible by 7 and 13. 

Trying 11, 87 is not prime either since it's divisible by 3. Next, with 13, 85 is also not prime because it's divisible by 5. 

When I test 17, 81 is not a prime number as it's divisible by 3 and 9. Continuing, with 19, 79 is a prime number. Therefore, the three prime numbers are 19, 7, and 2, which add up to 100.
</think>

**Solution:**

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow a systematic approach:

1. **Identify the Total and Even/Odd Considerations:**
   - The total sum is **100**, which is an **even** number.
   - **2** is the only even prime number. The rest of the prime numbers are odd.
   - Since the sum of two odd numbers is even, if we include **2** as one of the primes, the remaining two primes will add up to **98** (an even number).

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime (2):**
   - Let one of the primes be **2**.
   - Now, we need two more primes that add up to **98**.

3. **Find Prime Pairs Adding Up to 98:**
   - **Prime 3:**  
     - \( 98 - 3 = 95 \)  
     - **95** is **not** a prime number (divisible by 5).
   - **Prime 5:**  
     - \( 98 - 5 = 93 \)  
     - **93** is **not** a prime number (divisible by 3).
   - **Prime 7:**  
     - \( 98 - 7 = 91 \)  
     - **91** is **not** a prime number (divisible by 7 and 13).
   - **Prime 11:**  
     - \( 98 - 11 = 87 \)  
     - **87** is **not** a prime number (divisible by 3).
   - **Prime 13:**  
     - \( 98 - 13 = 85 \)  
     - **85** is **not** a prime number (divisible by 5).
   - **Prime 17:**  
     - \( 98 - 17 = 81 \)  
     - **81** is **not** a prime number (divisible by 9).
   - **Prime 19:**  
     - \( 98 - 19 = 79 \)  
     - **79** **is** a prime number.

4. **Confirm the Prime Triplet:**
   - The three primes are **2**, **7**, and **19**.
   - **Sum:** \( 2 + 7 + 19 = 100 \)
   - **Verification:**  
     - **2** is prime.  
     - **7** is prime.  
     - **19** is prime.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{2,\ 7,\ 19}
\]

Since 2 is the only even prime number, one of the three primes in the sum must be 2. This leaves me with finding two more prime numbers that add up to 98. I'll go through the list and see which two primes sum to 98.

Let me try pairing 3 with 95. 95 is not prime because it's divisible by 5. Next, 5 plus 93—93 is divisible by 3, so that's not prime either. Trying 7 and 91: 91 is 7 multiplied by 13, so it's not prime. Moving on, 11 and 87: 87 is divisible by 3. Then 13 and 85: 85 is divisible by 5. 

Next, 17 and 81: 81 is 9 squared, so it's not prime. 19 and 79: Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers. That works! So the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 19, 7, and 86. Wait, no, 86 is not prime. I made a mistake there. Let me check again.

If 19 and 79 are both primes, their sum is 98. Adding the initial 2 gives a total of 100. So the correct primes are 2, 19, and 79.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \).
   - Remember that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Identify the Smallest Prime:**
   - The only even prime number is **2**. Including 2 in our sum will help because it allows us to work with odd numbers, which are more common among primes (except for 2).

3. **Calculate the Remaining Sum:**
   - If we include 2, the remaining sum is \( 100 - 2 = 98 \).
   - Now, we need to find two prime numbers that add up to **98**.

4. **Find Prime Pairs for 98:**
   - List some prime numbers less than 98: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.
   - Start testing pairs:
     - **3 + 95 = 98** → 95 is not prime (divisible by 5).
     - **5 + 93 = 98** → 93 is not prime (divisible by 3).
     - **7 + 91 = 98** → 91 is not prime (divisible by 7 and 13).
     - **11 + 87 = 98** → 87 is not prime (divisible by 3).
     - **13 + 85 = 98** → 85 is not prime (divisible by 5).
     - **17 + 81 = 98** → 81 is not prime (divisible by 9).
     - **19 + 79 = 98** → **Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers!**

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The three prime numbers that add up to 100 are **2**, **19**, and **79**.

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
