<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by understanding the properties of prime numbers. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Next, I'll consider the even and odd nature of prime numbers. The only even prime number is 2; all other primes are odd. Since the sum of three numbers is 100, which is even, I need to determine how many of the primes can be 2.

If I include 2 as one of the primes, the remaining two primes must add up to 98. Since 98 is even, both remaining primes must be odd. This ensures that their sum will be even, which works because 2 is the only even prime.

Now, I'll look for pairs of odd primes that add up to 98. Starting with the smallest prime, 3, I'll check if (98 - 3) is also a prime. 95 is not a prime because it's divisible by 5. Moving to the next prime, 5, I'll check 93, which is divisible by 3. Continuing this process, I find that 7 and 91 are not both primes, 11 and 87 are not, and 13 and 85 are not.

Trying 17, I find that 81 is not a prime. Next, 19 and 79 are both primes. Therefore, the three primes that add up to 100 are 19, 79, and 2.

To find three prime numbers that add up to **100**, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The only even prime number is **2**. All other primes are odd.

2. **Analyze the Problem:**
   - We need three prime numbers that add up to **100**.
   - Since **100** is even, and **2** is the only even prime, it's likely one of the primes in our solution will be **2**.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   \[
   p + q + r = 100
   \]
   Where \( p, q, r \) are prime numbers.

4. **Assume One Prime is 2:**
   - Let \( p = 2 \).
   - Then, \( q + r = 100 - 2 = 98 \).

5. **Find Prime Pairs That Add Up to 98:**
   - Since **98** is even, both \( q \) and \( r \) must be odd primes.
   - Start with the smallest odd prime and check if \( 98 - q \) is also prime.

6. **Check Prime Pairs:**
   - \( q = 3 \): \( 98 - 3 = 95 \) (Not prime, divisible by 5)
   - \( q = 5 \): \( 98 - 5 = 93 \) (Not prime, divisible by 3)
   - \( q = 7 \): \( 98 - 7 = 91 \) (Not prime, divisible by 7)
   - \( q = 11 \): \( 98 - 11 = 87 \) (Not prime, divisible by 3)
   - \( q = 13 \): \( 98 - 13 = 85 \) (Not prime, divisible by 5)
   - \( q = 17 \): \( 98 - 17 = 81 \) (Not prime, divisible by 3)
   - \( q = 19 \): \( 98 - 19 = 79 \) (Prime)

7. **Identify the Solution:**
   - The primes are **2**, **19**, and **79**.
   - Verification:
     \[
     2 + 19 + 79 = 100
     \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by understanding the problem and recalling that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Next, I'll list the prime numbers less than 100 to have a reference. Then, I'll begin experimenting with different combinations of these primes, ensuring their sum equals 100.

I'll start with the largest prime under 100, which is 97. To reach 100 when added to 97, the remaining sum needed is 3. Checking the prime number list, 3 is indeed a prime. So, one possible solution is 3, 97, and 43, which adds up to 100.

I'll verify this combination by adding the numbers: 3 + 97 + 43 equals 143, which does not total 100. Therefore, I'll adjust my approach and look for smaller primes.

I'll consider another combination: 19, 43, and 38. However, 38 is not a prime number. I'll need to find other primes that sum up correctly.

Continuing my search, I find that 7, 43, and 50 add up to 100, but 50 is not prime. I'll discard this combination.

After several attempts, I finally discover that 3, 43, and 53 also add up to 100, and all three numbers are prime. I'll verify the sum: 3 + 43 + 53 equals 99, which is not 100. Realizing I made a calculation error, I'll re-evaluate.

Exploring another avenue, I find that 13, 47, and 40 sum to 100, but 40 is not prime. I'll continue searching.

Finally, I discover that 7, 41, and 52 add up to 100, but 52 is not prime. This trial and error method is proving to be time-consuming.

To optimize my approach, I'll use the fact that the sum of three primes must also be odd. Since 100 is even, two of the primes must be odd, and one must be even. The only even prime is 2. Therefore, one of the primes must be 2, and the other two primes must add up to 98.

With 2 as one prime, I'll look for two primes that add up to 98. Trying various primes, I find that 13 and 85 do not work because 85 is not prime. Continuing, I discover that 17 and 81 also do not work, and 19 and 79 are valid primes since both are prime and add up to 98.

Thus, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 2, 17, and 79.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \) such that:
\[
p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
\]
Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

**Step 2: List Prime Numbers Less Than 100**
Here are some prime numbers less than 100:
\[
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
\]

**Step 3: Find Three Prime Numbers That Add Up to 100**
We can approach this by testing combinations of the prime numbers. 

**Attempt 1:**
\[
p_1 = 3, \quad p_2 = 97, \quad p_3 = 43
\]
\[
3 + 97 + 43 = 143 \quad (\text{Not } 100)
\]

**Attempt 2:**
\[
p_1 = 19, \quad p_2 = 43, \quad p_3 = 38
\]
\[
38 \text{ is not a prime number.}
\]

**Attempt 3:**
\[
p_1 = 7, \quad p_2 = 41, \quad p_3 = 52
\]
\[
52 \text{ is not a prime number.}
\]

**Final Correct Combination:**
After several attempts, we find that:
\[
p_1 = 7, \quad p_2 = 41, \quad

Moving to the next prime, 5, I'll check 93, which is divisible by 3. Continuing this process, I find that 7 and 91 are not both primes, 11 and 87 are not, and 13 and 85 are not.
