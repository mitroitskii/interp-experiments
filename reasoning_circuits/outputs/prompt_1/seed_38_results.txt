<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that except for 2, all primes are odd. So, if I have three primes adding up to 100, which is an even number, I need to consider the parity of the primes. Let me recall that:

- Even + Even + Even = Even
- Even + Odd + Odd = Even
- Odd + Odd + Odd = Odd

Since 100 is even, the sum of three primes can be even in two cases: either all three are even, or two are odd and one is even. But the only even prime number is 2. So, if I use 2, then the other two primes would have to be odd because all primes except 2 are odd. That makes sense.

So, let's denote the three primes as 2, p, and q. Then, 2 + p + q = 100. Therefore, p + q = 98. Now, both p and q need to be prime numbers. Since p and q are odd primes, their sum will be even, which is 98, so that's consistent.

Now, I need to find two prime numbers that add up to 98. Let me think about how to find such pairs. Maybe I can list some primes and see if any pair adds up to 98.

Starting from the lower primes:

Let me list primes less than 98:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, I need two primes that add up to 98. Let me start with the smallest prime after 2, which is 3. So, 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 a prime? Hmm, 95 is divisible by 5 because it ends with a 5. So, 95 is not prime.

Next, 5: 98 - 5 = 93. Is 93 prime? 93 is divisible by 3 because 9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. So, 93 is not prime.

Next, 7: 98 - 7 = 91. Is 91 prime? Hmm, 91 is 7 times 13, so it's not prime.

Next, 11: 98 - 11 = 87. Is 87 prime? 8 + 7 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so 87 is not prime.

Next, 13: 98 - 13 = 85. 85 ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5, not prime.

Next, 17: 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9 squared, so not prime.

19: 98 - 19 = 79. Is 79 prime? Let me check. 79 is only divisible by 1 and itself. Let's see: 79 divided by 2 is not whole, 79 divided by 3 is about 26.3, not whole. 5? No, ends with 9. 7? 7*11 is 77, 7*12 is 84, so no. 11? 11*7=77, 11*8=88. So, 79 is prime. Okay, so 19 and 79 are primes, and they add up to 98. That works.

So, putting it all together, the three primes are 2, 19, and 79. Let me check: 2 + 19 + 79. 2 + 19 is 21, and 21 + 79 is 100. Perfect, that adds up.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't miss any other pairs, let me check a few more primes.

23: 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5, so not prime.

29: 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is 3*23, not prime.

31: 98 - 31 = 67. Is 67 prime? Yes, 67 is a prime number.

So, 31 and 67 are primes, and they add up to 98 as well. Therefore, another set is 2, 31, and 67. Let me verify: 2 + 31 is 33, plus

Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how I can approach this.

First, I know that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. So, if I consider the parity of the numbers, 2 is the only even prime. If I use three odd primes, their sum would be odd + odd + odd = odd. But 100 is even, so that won't work. That means I need to have either one even prime and two odd primes or maybe two even primes and one odd, but wait, there are no other even primes besides 2. So, I have to include 2 in the mix.

So, 2 is definitely going to be one of the primes. Then the other two primes need to add up to 100 - 2 = 98. So, now I need to find two prime numbers that add up to 98.

Let me think about pairs of primes that add up to 98. Since 98 is even, I remember that Goldbach's conjecture says that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. But wait, in this case, one of them is already fixed as 2, so we need two primes that add to 98.

Wait, no, sorry. After using 2, we need two primes to add to 98. So, 98 is even, so one of these primes could be even, but since the only even prime is 2, so the other one would be 98 - 2 = 96, which is not prime because it's even and greater than 2. So, that doesn't work.

Hmm, so both primes need to be odd. Therefore, primes such that both are odd and add to 98.

I think starting with small primes and moving up, checking if their complement is prime. Let me try 3: 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 prime? 95 divided by 5 is 19, so it's not prime.

Next, 5: 98 - 5 = 93. 93 is divisible by 3 (since 9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3), so 93 isn't prime.

7: 98 - 7 = 91. 91 is 13 times 7, so not prime.

11: 98 - 11 = 87. 87 is divisible by 3 (8 + 7 = 15, divisible by 3), so no.

13: 98 - 13 = 85. 85 ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5, not prime.

17: 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9 squared, so not prime.

19: 98 - 19 = 79. Hmm, is 79 prime? Let me check. 79: the square root is around 8.9, so I test primes up to 11. 79 divided by 3 is not whole, 79 divided by 5 no, 7? 7 times 11 is 77, 77 + 2 = 79, so 79 is prime. Okay, so 19 and 79 are primes that add to 98.

So, going back, the three primes are 2, 19, and 79, because 2 + 19 + 79 = 100.

Wait, let me double-check: 2 + 19 is 21, 21 + 79 is 100. Yes, that's correct.

But just to make sure I'm not missing another combination, let me see. Maybe starting from a higher prime. Let me try 23: 98 - 23 is 75, which is divisible by 5, not prime.

29: 98 - 29 = 69, which is 3×23, not prime.

31: 98 - 31 = 67. Is 67 prime? Let's see. Square root is about 8.1. 67 divided by 3: 6 + 7 = 13, not divisible by 3. Divided by 5? No, ends with 7. 7? 7*9=63, 67-63=4, so not divisible by 7. So 67 is prime. So another pair is 31 and 67.

Thus, 2, 31, and 67. Checking: 2 + 31 + 67 = 100. Yes, correct.

Wait, so is there another pair?

Continuing: 37: 98 - 37 = 61. Is
