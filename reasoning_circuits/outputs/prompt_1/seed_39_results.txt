<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by listing out some prime numbers less than 100.

Next, I'll consider the possible combinations of these primes to see which ones sum to 100. I'll begin with the smallest primes and work my way up.

After some trial and error, I find that 3, 7, and 90 is a valid combination, but since 90 is not a prime number, this doesn't work.

Continuing my search, I discover that 7, 11, and 82 is another combination, but 82 is also not a prime number.

I then try 7, 13, and 80, but again, 80 is not prime.

After several attempts, I find that 3, 11, and 86 is a valid combination. However, 86 is not a prime number either.

Finally, I find that 7, 19, and 74 is another combination, but 74 is not prime.

Since none of these combinations work, I realize that finding three prime numbers that add up to 100 is challenging.

Therefore, it seems that there are no three prime numbers that add up to 100.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's explore the possibilities step by step.

### Step 1: Understand Prime Numbers
A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime numbers less than 100 are:
\[ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 \]

### Step 2: Look for Triplets
We need to find three primes \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
\[ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \]

Let's consider the smallest prime, **2**, and see if it can be part of the triplet:
- If \( p_1 = 2 \), then \( p_2 + p_3 = 98 \).
- We need two primes that add up to 98. Let's check:
  - \( p_2 = 3 \), then \( p_3 = 95 \) (Not prime).
  - \( p_2 = 5 \), then \( p_3 = 93 \) (Not prime).
  - \( p_2 = 7 \), then \( p_3 = 91 \) (Not prime).
  - \( p_2 = 11 \), then \( p_3 = 87 \) (Not prime).
  - \( p_2 = 13 \), then \( p_3 = 85 \) (Not prime).
  - \( p_2 = 17 \), then \( p_3 = 81 \) (Not prime).
  - \( p_2 = 19 \), then \( p_3 = 79 \) (Prime).
  
So, one possible triplet is \( 2, 19, 79 \).

### Step 3: Verify the Triplet
Let's verify:
\[ 2 + 19 + 79 = 100 \]
\[ 2 + 19 + 79 = 100 \]

Yes, it adds up to 100, and all three numbers are prime.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, primes are like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

First, since the sum is 100, I should probably start by considering the properties of primes and how they can add up. Also, I should remember that except for the prime number 2, all other primes are odd. That might be useful because the sum of three odd numbers would be odd, but 100 is even. So, if I have three primes adding up to 100, which is even, I need to think about how the evenness plays in.

Let me think: if all three primes are odd, then the sum would be odd (since odd + odd + odd = odd). But 100 is even, so I can't have three odd primes adding to an even number. Therefore, one of the primes must be even, because even + odd + odd = even. The only even prime number is 2. So, one of the primes must be 2, and the other two must be odd primes that add up to 98 (since 100 - 2 = 98).

Okay, so now I just need to find two prime numbers that add up to 98. Let me start by considering that both primes should be as close as possible, so I can set one of them at around 50. Wait, but 50 is not a prime. Let me check primes near 50.

Starting from 47, the prime before 50: 47. So, 98 - 47 = 51. Is 51 a prime? Let me think. 51 divided by 3 is 17, so 51 is divisible by 3, meaning it's not prime. So, 47 and 51 don't work. Next, 43: 98 - 43 is 55. Is 55 a prime? 55 divided by 5 is 11, so no, 55 is not prime.

Moving on, let's try 41. 98 - 41 is 57. Is 57 prime? 57 divided by 3 is 19, so not prime. Next prime down is 37. 98 - 37 is 61. Is 61 a prime? Yes, 61 is a prime number. Okay, so 2, 37, and 61 add up to 100 because 2 + 37 + 61 = 100.

Wait a second, let me verify: 2 + 37 is 39, plus 61 is 100. That seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe there are other pairs as well. Let me check if 29 is a prime: 98 - 29 is 69. 69 divided by 3 is 23, so not prime. Next, 31: 98 -31 is 67, which is a prime. So, 2, 31, and 67 also add up to 100.

Another one: 13. 98 -13 is 85. 85 divided by 5 is 17, not prime. 17: 98 -17 is 81. 81 is not prime. 19: 98 -19 is 79. 79 is prime. So, 2, 19, 79.

Let me check that as well: 2 + 19 is 21, plus 79 is 100. That works too.

Hmm, so it seems like there are multiple solutions. Let me think, was 3 a possible candidate? If I use 3 instead of 2, would it work? Let's see: 100 - 3 = 97. So, we would need two primes that add up to 97. But 97 is a prime itself, but 97 is also odd, so if we subtract another prime from it, what do we get?

Wait, if we're doing 3 primes adding up to 100, and we use 3, then 100 -3 is 97, which needs to be expressed as the sum of two primes. But 97 is a prime number, so can 97 be written as the sum of two primes? Let me think. According to the Goldbach Conjecture, every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. But 97 is odd, so we can't apply Goldbach here because it applies to even numbers. So, 97 as an odd number, if we are trying to write it as the sum of two primes, one of them must be

### Step 2: Look for Triplets

\[ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \]

Let's consider the smallest prime, **2**, and see if it can be part of the triplet:
- If \( p_1 = 2 \), then \( p_2 + p_3 = 98 \).
- We need two primes that add up to 98. Let's check:

  - \( p_2 = 13 \), then \( p_3 = 85 \) (Not prime).
  - \( p_2 = 17 \), then \( p_3 = 81 \) (Not prime).
  - \( p_2 = 19 \), then \( p_3 = 79 \) (Prime).
  
So, one possible triplet is \( 2, 19, 79 \).

### Step 3: Verify the Triplet
Let's verify:
\[ 2 + 19 + 79 = 100 \]
\[ 2 + 19 + 79 = 100 \]

Yes, it adds up to 100, and all three numbers are prime.
