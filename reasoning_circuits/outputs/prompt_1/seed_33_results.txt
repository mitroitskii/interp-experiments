<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by considering the properties of prime numbers. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The smallest prime number is 2, which is also the only even prime number.

Next, I'll think about the sum of three primes. Since 2 is the only even prime, I can use it in the combination. If one of the numbers is 2, the remaining sum to reach 100 is 98, which needs to be divided equally between the other two primes. So, 98 divided by 2 is 49. This means I'm looking for two prime numbers that add up to 49.

I'll list out prime numbers less than 49 and check which pairs sum to 49. Starting with 2, 49 minus 2 is 47, which is also a prime number. This gives me the combination 2, 47, and 49. However, 49 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 7. Therefore, this combination doesn't work.

Moving on to the next prime number, 3, I'll subtract it from 49 to get 46. But 46 is not a prime number. Next, with 5, 49 minus 5 is 44, which is also not prime. Continuing this process, I find that none of the subsequent pairs of primes add up to 49.

Since using 2 didn't work, I'll try using 3 as one of the primes. This means I need two other primes that add up to 97. Checking the list of primes, I find that 97 is itself a prime number, but that doesn't help because I need two primes. Therefore, this approach also doesn't yield a valid combination.

Finally, I'll consider using 5 as one of the primes. Subtracting 5 from 100 gives me 95, which needs to be divided between two primes. However, 95 is not an even number, and after checking, I realize that no pairs of primes add up to 95.

After exploring these possibilities, I realize that there might not be three prime numbers that add up to 100. It appears that either one of the numbers in the combination is not prime or the sum doesn't meet the required total.

**Solution:**

We are tasked with finding three prime numbers that add up to 100. Let's denote these prime numbers as \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \). Our goal is to find \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) such that:

\[
p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
\]

**Step 1: Understanding Prime Numbers**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The smallest prime number is 2, which is also the only even prime number. All other prime numbers are odd.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Parity of the Sum**

- Since 2 is the only even prime number, we need to consider whether one of the primes is 2.
- If one of the primes is 2, then the sum of the other two primes must be \( 100 - 2 = 98 \).
- The sum of two numbers with the same parity is even. Since 98 is even, both \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) must be odd primes.

**Step 3: Finding Two Odd Primes That Sum to 98**

Let's list the prime numbers less than 98 and find pairs that add up to 98:

1. \( 3 + 95 \): 95 is not a prime number.
2. \( 5 + 93 \): 93 is not a prime number.
3. \( 7 + 91 \): 91 is not a prime number.
4. \( 11 + 87 \): 87 is not a prime number.
5. \( 13 + 85 \): 85 is not a prime number.
6. \( 17 + 81 \): 81 is not a prime number.
7. \( 19 + 79 \): Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers.

**Step 4: Verifying the Solution**

We found that:

\[
3 + 19 + 79 = 101
\]

However, this sum equals 101, not 100. Therefore, this combination is not valid.

**Step 5: Trying a Different Approach**

Since using 2 as one of the primes didn't yield a valid combination, let's try using 3 as one of the primes:

1. \( 3 + p_

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I start by understanding that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. 

First, I consider the largest prime number less than 100, which is 97. If I include 97 in the set, the remaining sum to reach 100 is 3. However, 3 is a prime number, so one potential set is {3, 97}.

Next, I notice that this set consists of only two prime numbers, so I need to include a third number. Since 3 plus 97 equals 100, there is no need for a third number in this case.

Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 3, 5, and 92. Upon verifying each number:
- 3 is a prime number.
- 5 is a prime number.
- 92 is not a prime number because it is even and greater than 2, making it divisible by 2.

It appears there was a misunderstanding in the initial problem. To accurately find three prime numbers that sum to 100, I need to explore other combinations.

Starting with smaller prime numbers, I include 3 and then consider pairs of primes that add up to 97. One such pair is 5 and 82, but 82 is not prime. Trying another pair, I find 7 and 90, but 90 is not prime either.

Continuing this process, I discover that 11 and 86 also do not work, as 86 is not prime. It seems challenging to find three prime numbers that add up to 100 without using even numbers beyond 2, which are not prime.

Finally, I consider using the prime number 2, as it is the only even prime number. Including 2 in the set allows me to use other odd primes. After several attempts, I find that 3, 5, and 92 is not valid, so I try different combinations until I find that 3, 7, and 90 does not work. Repeating this process, I find that no valid combination of three prime numbers adds up to 100.

It seems that there might be no set of three prime numbers that add up to 100, but I need to verify this. Upon reviewing prime numbers and their sums, I confirm that such a combination is not possible. Therefore, the initial answer provided needs to be revised.

**Solution:**

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's consider the properties of prime numbers and explore possible combinations.

1. **Prime Number Definition:** A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Sum to 100:** We need three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
   \[
   p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
   \]

3. **Considering Even and Odd Primes:**
   - Except for the prime number 2, all other primes are odd.
   - The sum of three odd numbers is odd. Adding 2 (the only even prime) to two odd primes results in an even sum.

4. **Possible Combinations:**
   - **Using 2 as one prime:**
     - Let \( p_1 = 2 \). Then, \( p_2 + p_3 = 98 \).
     - Both \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) must be odd primes adding up to 98.
     - Looking for primes that sum to 98:
       - \( 3 + 95 = 98 \) (but 95 is not prime)
       - \( 7 + 91 = 98 \) (91 is not prime)
       - \( 11 + 87 = 98 \) (87 is not prime)
       - \( 13 + 85 = 98 \) (85 is not prime)
       - \( 17 + 81 = 98 \) (81 is not prime)
       - \( 19 + 79 = 98 \) (both primes)
     - **Solution Found:** \( 2 + 19 + 79 = 100 \)

5. **Verification:**
   - **19** is a prime number.
   - **79** is a prime number.
   - **2 + 19 + 79 = 100**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]
