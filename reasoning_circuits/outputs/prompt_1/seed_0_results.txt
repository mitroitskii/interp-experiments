<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by considering the smallest prime number, which is 2. If I include 2 in the set, the remaining sum to reach 100 is 98.

Next, I'll look for two prime numbers that add up to 98. Let's try 17 and 81. However, 81 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 9. I'll try another pair, such as 19 and 79. Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers.

Now, I'll verify the sum: 2 + 19 + 79 equals 100. This means the three prime numbers are 2, 19, and 79.

   \]
   
   Now, the remaining sum to reach 100 is:
   
   \[
   100 - 2 = 98
   \]
   
3. **Find Two Prime Numbers that Add Up to 98:**
   
   We need to find two prime numbers \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) such that:
   
   \[
   p_2 + p_3 = 98
   \]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Let's start by understanding the properties of prime numbers—they are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Next, I'll consider the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see if using it can lead to a solution. If I include 2 in the trio, the remaining two primes must add up to 98.

Now, I'll think about the distribution of prime numbers around 98. If I take the next prime number after 2, which is 3, and subtract it from 98, I get 95. I'll check if 95 is a prime number, but it's divisible by 5, so it's not prime.

Moving on, if I take the next prime number, 5, subtracting it from 98 gives me 93. However, 93 is divisible by 3, so it's not prime either. Continuing this process, subtracting 7 from 98 gives me 91, which is also divisible by 7 and thus not a prime number.

I'll try 11 next. Subtracting 11 from 98 results in 87, which is divisible by 3 and therefore not prime. Continuing with 13, I get 85, which is divisible by 5, so it's not prime.

Trying 17, subtracting from 98 gives me 81, which is divisible by 9. Moving on to 19, subtracting it from 98 results in 79. Finally, 79 is a prime number.

So, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 3, 19, and 79.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The smallest prime number is **2**, and it's the only even prime number.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime (2):**
   - Let's include **2** in our set of primes. Then, the remaining two primes must add up to **98**.

3. **Find Two Primes That Add Up to 98:**
   - Let’s denote the two primes as \( p \) and \( q \), where \( p > 2 \) (since 2 is already used).
   - We need to find primes such that:
     \[
     p + q = 98
     \]
   - Since both \( p \) and \( q \) are odd (all primes greater than 2 are odd), their sum **98** is even, which is consistent.

4. **Try Different Prime Numbers:**
   - **3 and 95:** 95 is not prime (divisible by 5).
   - **5 and 93:** 93 is not prime (divisible by 3).
   - **7 and 91:** 91 is not prime (divisible by 7).
   - **11 and 87:** 87 is not prime (divisible by 3).
   - **13 and 85:** 85 is not prime (divisible by 5).
   - **17 and 81:** 81 is not prime (divisible by 9).
   - **19 and 79:** Both are prime numbers.

5. **Final Check:**
   - The primes **19** and **79** are both prime and their sum is:
     \[
     19 + 79 = 98
     \]
   - Adding the initial **2**:
     \[
     2 + 19 + 79 = 100
     \]
   - Thus, **2, 19, and 79** are the prime numbers that add up to 100.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]
