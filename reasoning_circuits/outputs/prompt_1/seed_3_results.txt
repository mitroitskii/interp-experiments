<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by listing the prime numbers less than 100, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

Next, I'll consider the possibility of including the smallest prime number, 2, in the triplet. This leaves me with a sum of 98 to be divided between the other two primes.

I'll look for pairs of primes that add up to 98. After checking several combinations, I find that 19 and 79 are both prime numbers and their sum is 98.

Finally, adding 2 to 19 and 79 gives me the triplet (2, 19, 79), which adds up to 100.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find three prime numbers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that:
     \[
     p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
     \]
   
2. **List of Prime Numbers:**
   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.
   - Some prime numbers less than 100 include: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

3. **Strategy:**
   - Start by considering the smallest prime number, **2**, since it is the only even prime number. This allows the other two primes to be odd, which is necessary because the sum of two odd numbers is even, and adding 2 will result in an odd total (100 is even, so two odd primes sum to 98, which is even).
   
4. **Find Two Primes That Sum to 98:**
   - We need to find two prime numbers \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) such that:
     \[
     p_2 + p_3 = 98
     \]
   - Check pairs of primes to see if their sum is 98.
     - \( 19 + 79 = 98 \) (Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers.)

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Combine the three primes:
     \[
     2 + 19 + 79 = 100
     \]
   
   - **Answer:** \( 2, 19, 79 \)

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

First, I'll consider the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see if it can be part of the solution.

Next, I'll try to find two prime numbers that add up to 98. This fy, when I add them to 2, the total will be 100.

After some calculations, I find that 19 and 79 are both prime numbers and their sum is 98.

Finally, adding them together with 2, I get 2 + 19 + 79 = 100.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, follow these steps:

1. **Start with the smallest prime number:**
   
   The smallest prime number is **2**. Let's include this in our sum.

   \[
   2 + p + q = 100
   \]
   
   So, we need to find two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that:

   \[
   p + q = 98
   \]

2. **Find prime numbers that add up to 98:**
   
   We can look for prime pairs that sum to 98. Let's try different pairs:

   - **Pair (3, 95):**
     - 3 is prime.
     - 95 is **not** prime (divisible by 5 and 19).
     
   - **Pair (7, 91):**
     - 7 is prime.
     - 91 is **not** prime (7 × 13).
     
   - **Pair (13, 85):**
     - 13 is prime.
     - 85 is **not** prime (5 × 17).
     
   - **Pair (19, 79):**
     - 19 is prime.
     - 79 is prime.
     
   *Both 19 and 79 are prime numbers and their sum is 98.*

3. **Verify the Solution:**
   
   Adding all three primes together:
   
   \[
   2 + 19 + 79 = 100
   \]
   
   Therefore, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are:

   \[
   \boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
   \]
