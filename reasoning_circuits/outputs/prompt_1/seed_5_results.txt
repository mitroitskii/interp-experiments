<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100.

First, I should recall that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

I'll start by considering the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see if it can be part of the solution.

If I take 2 as one of the primes, then the sum of the other two primes would need to be 98.

Next, I'll look for two primes that add up to 98. Let's consider 19 and 79. Both of these are prime numbers.

Finally, I'll verify that all three numbers are prime and that their sum is indeed 100.

So, the three prime numbers are 2, 19, and 79.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Examples of prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, etc.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   \[
   p + q + r = 100
   \]
   where \( p \), \( q \), and \( r \) are prime numbers.

3. **Consider the Smallest Prime (2):**
   - Since 2 is the only even prime number, including it in the equation allows the other two primes to be odd (as the sum of two odd numbers is even, and adding 2 makes it even, which is necessary for 100).

4. **Find Two Primes That Add Up to 98:**
   - Let \( p = 2 \).
   - Then, \( q + r = 98 \).
   - We look for two prime numbers that add up to 98.

5. **Find Prime Pairs for 98:**
   - **Example Pair:** 19 and 79.
     - Check if both are prime.
     - **19** is prime.
     - **79** is prime.
     - **19 + 79 = 98**.

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - **Primes:** 2, 19, and 79.
   - **Sum:** \( 2 + 19 + 79 = 100 \).

7. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
   \]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100.

First, let me consider the prime number 3. If I take three 3s, their sum is 9, which is much less than 100.

Next, I'll try the prime number 7. Combining seven 7s gives 49, which is still below 100.

Then, I'll consider the prime number 13. Thirteen 13s add up to 169, which is greater than 100. I need to find smaller numbers.

I notice that using the prime number 5 might be a good starting point. Trying five 5s gives 25, which is still too low. To reach 100, I'll need to combine 5s with other primes.

Let me try using eleven 5s, which sum to 55. I now have a remaining difference of 45. Using the prime number 3 could help achieve this. Adding fifteen 3s to the eleven 5s gives 55 + 45 = 100. This combination uses the primes 5 and 3, and eleven of each meet the requirements.

Thus, the three prime numbers are eleven 5s and fifteen 3s, totaling 33 prime numbers that add up to 100.
</think>

**Solution:**

We are looking for three prime numbers that add up to 100. Let's denote these primes as \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \) such that:

\[
p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
\]

To find such primes, let's consider the following approach:

1. **Choosing Small Primes:**
   
   Start by selecting smaller prime numbers and check how many of each are needed to sum up to 100.

2. **Testing \( p_1 = 3 \):**

   - If we take three primes of 3:
     \[
     3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \quad (\text{too small})
     \]
   
3. **Testing \( p_1 = 7 \):**

   - Seven primes of 7:
     \[
     7 \times 7 = 49 \quad (\text{too small})
     \]
   
4. **Testing \( p_1 = 13 \):**

   - Thirteen primes of 13:
     \[
     13 \times 13 = 169 \quad (\text{too large})
     \]
   
   Since 13 is too large, let's try combining smaller primes to reach closer to 100.

5. **Using 5s:**

   Let's try using the prime number 5 first. If we take five 5s:
   \[
   5 \times 5 = 25
   \]
   
   This is still too small. To make the sum closer to 100, we can combine multiple 5s with other primes.

6. **Combining 5s and 3s:**

   Let's try using eleven 5s:
   \[
   5 \times 11 = 55
   \]
   
   Now, we need an additional \( 100 - 55 = 45 \). We can use the prime number 3 to reach this.
   
   - Let's use fifteen 3s:
     \[
     3 \times 15 = 45
     \]
   
   Combining these, we have:
   \[
   5 \times 11 + 3 \times 15 = 55 + 45 = 100
   \]
   
   This combination uses eleven 5s and fifteen 3s, all of which are prime numbers.

7. **Final Answer:**

   Therefore, three prime numbers that add up to 100 are:

   \[
   \boxed{5,\ 3,\ \text{(11 times)}\ 5,\ \text{(15 times)}\ 3}
   \]
