<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. I'll start by listing out the prime numbers less than 100 to have a reference.

Next, I'll consider the possible combinations of three primes. Since 2 is the only even prime, it might be helpful to use it as one of the numbers to achieve an odd sum of 100.

I'll set one of the primes as 2 and then look for two other primes that add up to 98. This reduces the problem to finding two primes that sum to 98.

Checking the list of primes, I'll test different pairs. For example, 13 and 85: 13 is prime, but 85 is not. Trying 19 and 79: both are primes, so this combination works.

Finally, I'll verify that 2, 19, and 79 are all primes and that their sum is indeed 100.

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The prime numbers less than 100 include: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

2. **Strategy:**
   - Since 2 is the only even prime, using it in the combination will allow the other two numbers to be odd (since the sum of two odd numbers is even).
   - We need to find two prime numbers that add up to \(100 - 2 = 98\).

3. **Find Prime Pairs that Add Up to 98:**
   - **Pair 1:** \(13 + 85 = 98\)  
     - **Check:** 13 is prime, but 85 is **not** prime (since \(85 = 5 \times 17\)).
   - **Pair 2:** \(19 + 79 = 98\)  
     - **Check:** Both 19 and 79 are prime.
   
4. **Final Combination:**
   - **Prime Numbers:** 2, 19, and 79.
   - **Verification:**  
     - \(2 + 19 + 79 = 100\)
     - All numbers are prime.

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]

First, I want to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Since all prime numbers are greater than 1, the smallest possible primes to consider are 3, 5, and 7.

Next, I'll look for combinations of these primes and check if their sum is 100. Let's try 3, 5, and 92. However, 92 is not a prime number because it is even and greater than 2.

I'll try the next combination: 3, 7, and 90. Again, 90 is even and not a prime number. Moving on, I'll test 3, 11, and 86. The number 86 is also even and therefore not a prime.

Continuing this process, I test 3, 13, and 84. Still, 84 is even and not prime. I'll try 3, 17, and 80. The number 80 is even, so it isn't a prime either.

Now, I'll test 3, 19, and 78. Once more, 78 is even and not prime. I'll proceed to 3, 23, and 74, but 74 is also even and not a prime number.

Finally, I'll try 3, 29, and 68. Again, 68 is even and not prime. It seems like adding 3 to another prime number doesn't work because the third number becomes even and thus not prime. Therefore, 3 cannot be one of the primes in the solution.

I'll now consider starting with a larger prime number. Let's try 5, 7, and 88. The number 88 is even and not prime. Trying 5, 11, and 84, I find that 84 is again even and not prime.

Continuing, I'll test 5, 13, and 82. The number 82 is even and not prime. Next, 5, 17, and 78. Still, 78 is even and not prime. I'll try 5, 19, and 76. Once more, 76 is even and not prime.

I'll try 5, 23, and 72. The number 72 is even and not prime. Next, 5, 29, and 66. Again, 66 is even and not prime. I'll proceed to 5, 31, and 64. The number 64 is even and not prime.

Trying 5, 37, and 58, I find that 58 is even and not prime. Next, 5, 41, and 54. The number 54 is even and not prime. I'll test 5, 43, and 52. The number 52 is even and not prime.

Now, I'll test 5, 47, and 48. The number 48 is even and not prime. It appears that adding 5 to other primes also results in the third number being even and not prime.

I'll now try starting with the prime number 7. Testing 7, 11, and 82, I find that 82 is even and not prime. Trying 7, 13, and 80, the number 80 is even and not prime. Continuing with 7, 17, and 76, again 76 is even and not prime.

I'll test 7, 19, and 74. The number 74 is even and not prime. Next, 7, 23, and 70. The number 70 is even and not prime. I'll try 7, 29, and 64. The number 64 is even and not prime.

Testing 7, 31, and 62, I find that 62 is even and not prime. Next, 7, 37, and 56. The number 56 is even and not prime. Trying 7, 41, and 52, the number 52 is even and not prime.

Testing 7, 43, and 50, I find that 50 is even and not prime. Finally, I'll test 7, 47, and 46. The number 46 is even and not prime.

It seems that starting with 7 doesn't work either since the third number is consistently even and not prime.

After trying various combinations starting with different primes, I realize that if I add two odd primes together, the result is even. To reach a sum of 100, which is also even, the third number must be even. However, the only even prime number is 2.

Therefore, one of the three primes must be 2. Let's try this approach. If 2 is one of the primes, then the sum of the other
