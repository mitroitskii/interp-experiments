<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. So, if I'm adding three primes together, there are different scenarios based on whether they include 2 or not. Let me consider the possibilities.

Case 1: All three primes are odd. If I add three odd numbers, the sum will be odd + odd + odd = odd + even = odd. But 100 is even, so this case is impossible. Therefore, at least one of the primes has to be even, and the only even prime is 2.

Case 2: Exactly one of the primes is 2. Then, the other two primes must be odd. So, the sum would be 2 + odd + odd = even + even = even. Since 100 is even, this is possible.

Case 3: More than one prime is 2. That would mean 2 + 2 + something. But 2 + 2 = 4, so the third prime would need to be 96. However, 96 is not a prime because it's divisible by 2, 3, 5, etc. So, this case isn't possible either.

Therefore, we can conclude that exactly one of the primes must be 2, and the other two must be odd primes that add up to 98.

So now, the problem reduces to finding two prime numbers that add up to 98. Let me denote them as p and q, where p and q are primes, and p + q = 98.

Since both p and q must be odd primes, their sum is even, which fits because 98 is even. Let me start checking for primes less than 98.

Let me list some primes less than 98: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Wait, 97 is prime, but 97 is more than half of 98, so if p is 97, then q would be 1, which is not prime. So, maybe I should start checking from lower primes.

Let me start with 3: If p = 3, then q = 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 prime? 95 is divisible by 5 (since it ends with a 5), so no.

Next, p = 5: q = 98 - 5 = 93. Is 93 prime? 93 is divisible by 3 (since 9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3). So, no.

p = 7: q = 98 - 7 = 91. 91 is 7*13, so not prime.

p = 11: q = 98 - 11 = 87. 87 is divisible by 3 (8 + 7 = 15, which is divisible by 3). Not prime.

p = 13: q = 98 - 13 = 85. 85 is divisible by 5 (ends with 5). Not prime.

p = 17: q = 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9*9, so not prime.

p = 19: q = 98 - 19 = 79. Hmm, 79 is a prime number! Let me confirm: 79 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Let's see: 7*11 is 77, which is less than 79, and the next prime after 7 is 11, and 79 is not divisible by either. So yes, 79 is prime.

So, the primes are 2, 19, and 79. Let me check: 2 + 19 + 79 = 100. Perfect!

But wait, let me make sure there are no other combinations. Maybe there's another pair that adds to 98.

Continuing from p = 23: q = 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5, not prime.

p = 29: q = 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is divisible by 3 (6 + 9 = 15). Not prime.

p = 31: q = 98 - 31 = 67. 67 is a prime number. Let

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem: find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how I can approach this. First off, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the primes I know start from 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

Now, I need three primes that add up to 100. Let me write that down as an equation: p1 + p2 + p3 = 100, where each p is a prime number. I guess one thing to note here is that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. So, primes like 2, 3, 5, etc. Now, if I think about the sum of three primes, I should consider how their parity affects the total.

Let me recall that the sum of two odd numbers is even, and the sum of three odd numbers is odd. So, if I have three primes, and all of them are odd, their sum would be odd. But 100 is even, so that means that the number of odd primes in the trio must be even. Because odd + odd + odd = odd, which doesn't add up to 100. Wait, actually, odd + odd = even, and even + odd = odd. So, if I have two odds and one even, the sum would be even. Since 100 is even, it makes sense that two of the primes are odd, and one of them is even. The only even prime number is 2, so one of the primes has to be 2. Makes sense.

So, that simplifies things a bit. Let me denote p1 = 2, so now the equation becomes 2 + p2 + p3 = 100. That simplifies to p2 + p3 = 98. Now, both p2 and p3 have to be primes, and their sum is 98.

Now, 98 is even, so again, same logic as before: if we have two primes adding to an even number, they can both be odd, because odd + odd = even. So, both p2 and p3 must be odd primes greater than 2. So, I just need to find two primes that add up to 98.

Hmm, okay, how do I find those? Maybe I can start by listing primes less than 98 and see if any pair adds up to 98.

Wait, 98 is just 14 less than 100, so I might need to find two primes that are close to 50 each. But I don't know if that's accurate. Let me think. Maybe starting from the middle.

Wait, 49 is 49, which isn't prime. 47 is prime, so 47 + 51=98. Is 51 prime? No, it's divisible by 3 and 17. Okay, moving on.

Next, 43 is prime. 98 - 43 = 55. Is 55 prime? No, divisible by 5 and 11. Next, 41 is prime. 98 - 41 = 57. 57 is divisible by 3 and 19. Not prime.

Next, 37 is prime. 98 - 37 = 61. Is 61 prime? Yes, 61 is a prime number. So, there we go: 37 and 61. Let me check: 37 + 61 = 98, which is correct.

So, that means p2 = 37 and p3 = 61. So, the three primes are 2, 37, and 61. Let me check if their sum is 100: 2 + 37 is 39, plus 61 is 100. Perfect.

Wait, but just to make sure there aren't other combinations, because the problem doesn't specify whether it's looking for one set or all possible sets. Since the user just says "find three prime numbers that add up to 100," it seems like any such trio is acceptable.

But for the sake of thoroughness, let me see if there are other pairs that add up to 98.

Continuing from where I left off, after 37 and 61, the next prime is 31. 98 - 31 = 67. Is 67 prime? Yes, so 31 and 67. So, that's another combination: 2, 31, 67. Their sum is also 100.

Continuing, next prime is 29. 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is not prime, as it's divisible by 3. Next prime is 23. 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is not prime, divisible by
