<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, I'll start by considering the properties of prime numbers. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

I know that 2 is the only even prime number. Since 100 is an even number, including 2 in the sum will help in achieving the target.

Next, I'll subtract 2 from 100, leaving 98. Now, I need two prime numbers that add up to 98. To make this easier, I'll look for primes that are close to each other.

I'll try 47 and 51. However, 51 is not a prime number because it's divisible by 3. 

Then, I'll consider 43 and 55. Again, 55 is not a prime number since it's divisible by 5.

Trying 41 and 57, I find that 57 is not prime as it's divisible by 3.

Next, I'll test 37 and 61. Both 37 and 61 are prime numbers, and their sum is 98.

Finally, adding the initial 2, the three prime numbers that add up to 100 are 2, 37, and 61.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to 100, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The only even prime number is **2**. All other prime numbers are odd.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let the three prime numbers be \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \).
   - We have:
     \[
     p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
     \]

3. **Include the Only Even Prime (2):**
   - Since 2 is the only even prime, include it in the sum:
     \[
     2 + p_2 + p_3 = 100
     \]
     \[
     p_2 + p_3 = 98
     \]
   
4. **Find Two Prime Numbers That Add Up to 98:**
   - Both \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \) must be odd primes (since 2 is already used).
   - The sum of two odd numbers is even, so 98 is achievable.

5. **Test Possible Prime Pairs:**
   - **Example 1:** Let \( p_2 = 37 \) and \( p_3 = 61 \)
     - Check if both are prime:
       - 37 is prime (divisible only by 1 and 37).
       - 61 is prime (divisible only by 1 and 61).
     - Verify the sum:
       \[
       2 + 37 + 61 = 100
       \]
   
6. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{2,\ 37,\ 61}
   \]

<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Let me start by understanding that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

I can consider whether all three primes need to be different or if they can include the same number twice.

To simplify, I'll begin by trying to find one even prime number in the trio since the only even prime is 2. Adding 2 to the remaining sum will give me a new target of 98.

Next, I'll look for pairs of prime numbers that add up to 98. I'll list out some primes less than 98 and check their combinations.

After testing several pairs, I find that 3 and 95 are both primes and add up to 98. Therefore, the three primes that add up to 100 are 3, 2, and 95.
</think>

To find three prime numbers that add up to **100**, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than **1** that has no positive divisors other than **1** and itself.
   - The only even prime number is **2**. All other primes are odd.

2. **Identify the Role of 2:**
   - Since **2** is the only even prime, we can consider whether to include it in our set of three primes.
   - If we include **2**, the remaining sum to reach **100** is **98**.

3. **Find Two Prime Numbers That Add Up to 98:**
   - We can look for two primes, say **p** and **q**, such that:
     \[
     p + q = 98
     \]
   - Let's try pairs of primes less than **98**:
     - **3** and **95**:
       - **3** is a prime.
       - **95** is a prime? Let's check:
         - **95** is divisible by **5** and **19**.
         - **95** is **not** a prime.
       - This pair does not work.

     - **7** and **91**:
       - **91** is divisible by **7** and **13**.
       - **91** is **not** a prime.

     - **11** and **87**:
       - **87** is divisible by **3** and **29**.
       - **87** is **not** a prime.

     - **13** and **85**:
       - **85** is divisible by **5** and **17**.
       - **85** is **not** a prime.

     - **17** and **81**:
       - **81** is divisible by **3**.
       - **81** is **not** a prime.

     - **19** and **79**:
       - Both **19** and **79** are primes.
       - **19 + 79 = 98**

   - Perfect! We've found a valid pair: **19** and **79**.

4. **Combine the Results:**
   - Our three primes are:
     \[
     2, \ 19, \ 79
     \]
   - Let's verify:
     \[
     2 + 19 + 79 = 100
     \]
   - All numbers are prime.

\[
\boxed{2,\ 19,\ 79}
\]
