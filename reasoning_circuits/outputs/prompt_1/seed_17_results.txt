<｜User｜>Find three prime numbers that add up to 100.<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. So, if I'm adding three primes together, I should consider whether I'm using the even prime (which is 2) or not. Because adding three odd numbers would give me an odd total, but 100 is even. So, to get an even sum, I need to have either one even prime and two odd primes or all three primes even. But since only 2 is even, the only way is to include 2 and have the other two primes be odd.

So, let me set one of the primes as 2. Then, the sum of the other two primes would be 100 - 2 = 98. Now, I need to find two primes that add up to 98.

Wait, is 98 even? Yes, it is. So, similar to before, if I have two primes adding up to an even number, 98, one of them has to be even as well because an even plus an odd is odd, and 98 is even. But the only even prime is 2. So, does that mean one of the two primes is 2? Let me check.

If one of them is 2, then the other would be 98 - 2 = 96. Is 96 a prime? No, because it's divisible by 2, 3, 4, etc. So, that doesn't work. Hmm, so if 2 is already used, can I use another even prime? But 2 is the only even prime, so I can't have another even number. That means that both primes adding up to 98 have to be odd, which is possible because an odd plus an odd is even.

So, let me try to find two primes that add up to 98. Let me list some primes less than 98 and see if any pair adds up to 98.

Starting from the lower primes:

3: 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 prime? 95 is divisible by 5 because it ends with a 5, so no.

5: 98 - 5 = 93. 93 is divisible by 3 (since 9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3), so not prime.

7: 98 - 7 = 91. 91 is 7 times 13, so not prime.

11: 98 - 11 = 87. 87 is divisible by 3, so not prime.

13: 98 - 13 = 85. 85 is divisible by 5, not prime.

17: 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9 squared, not prime.

19: 98 - 19 = 79. Is 79 prime? Let me think. 79 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Let me check: 7*11 is 77, so 79 is prime. Yes, 79 is prime. So, 19 and 79 are both primes, and they add up to 98.

Therefore, the three primes would be 2, 19, and 79. Let me check: 2 + 19 is 21, plus 79 is 100. Yes, that adds up.

Wait, but hold on, is there another set of primes? Maybe I can find another combination. Let me continue checking.

23: 98 - 23 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5, not prime.

29: 98 - 29 = 69. 69 is divisible by 3, not prime.

31: 98 - 31 = 67. 67 is prime. So, 31 and 67 add up to 98. Therefore, the three primes would be 2, 31, and 67. Let me check: 2 + 31 is 33, plus 67 is 100. Yep, that works.

Continuing, 37: 98 - 37 = 61. 61 is prime. So, 37 and 61 add up to 98. Therefore, the primes would be 2, 37, and 61. 2 + 37 is 39, plus 61 is 100. Perfect.

41: 98 - 41 = 57. 57 is divisible by 3, not prime.

43: 98 - 43 = 55. 55 is divisible by 5, not prime.

47: 98 - 47

Okay, so I need to find three prime numbers that add up to 100. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me think about how I can approach this.

First off, the primes include numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. I remember that 2 is the only even prime number. All other primes are odd. Now, if I'm adding three prime numbers to get 100, which is an even number, that might affect what kind of primes I can use.

Let me consider the parity here. 100 is even. If I add three numbers, their sum's parity depends on how many odd numbers are added. Each odd number has a different effect on the parity:

- Odd + Odd + Odd = Odd (because Odd + Odd = Even, and Even + Odd = Odd)
- Even + Even + Even = Even (but 2 is the only even prime)
- Even + Odd + Odd = Even (because Even + Odd + Odd = Even + Even = Even)

Since 100 is even, I need the sum of three primes to be even. So, either all three primes are odd, which would result in an odd sum (which won't work), or exactly one of them is even (which has to be 2) and the other two are odd, resulting in an even sum. So, the possible cases are:

1. All three primes are odd: 100 is even, but the sum would be odd (since 3 odds add up to odd). Not possible.
2. Exactly one prime is 2 (the only even prime), and the other two are odd primes: This will give us an even sum, which is 100. So, this is the case we should focus on.

So, that means we're looking for two odd primes (let's call them P and Q) such that 2 + P + Q = 100, which implies that P + Q = 98. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding two primes that add up to 98.

Now, I need to find two prime numbers that sum to 98. Let me think about how to approach this. I can try different even numbers near 98 and check if their complements are prime.

Wait, no, since 98 is even and 2 is the only even prime, if I pair 2 with another prime, the other prime would have to be 96, which is even and not prime. So, 2 can't be paired with another prime to get 98, because 96 is not prime. Therefore, both primes must be odd, which means both are odd numbers.

So, we need to find primes P and Q such that P + Q = 98. Now, 98 is even, so it's the sum of two odd primes, which works because odd + odd = even. So, we can look for primes below 98 and check if their complement (98 - prime) is also a prime.

Let me list some primes below 98:

3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now, starting from the smallest prime, let's check:

Start with 3: 98 - 3 = 95. Is 95 prime? 95 is divisible by 5 (since it ends with 5), so no.

Next, 5: 98 - 5 = 93. 93 is divisible by 3 (9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3). So, 93 is not prime.

7: 98 - 7 = 91. 91 is 13*7, so not prime.

11: 98 - 11 = 87. 87 is 3*29, so not prime.

13: 98 - 13 = 85. 85 is 5*17, not prime.

17: 98 - 17 = 81. 81 is 9*9, which is 3^4, so not prime.

19: 98 - 19 = 79. Hmm, 79 is a prime number. Okay, so 19 and 79 are both primes. Let me confirm that.

Yes, 19 is prime (divisible only by 1 and 19) and 79 is prime as well (divisible only by 1 and 79). So, 19 + 79 = 98, which means 2 + 19 + 79 =

31: 98 - 31 = 67. 67 is prime. So, 31 and 67 add up to 98. Therefore, the three primes would be 2, 31, and 67. Let me check: 2 + 31 is 33, plus 67 is 100. Yep, that works.

Continuing, 37: 98 - 37 = 61. 61 is prime. So, 37 and 61 add up to 98. Therefore, the primes would be 2, 37, and 61. 2 + 37 is 39, plus 61 is 100. Perfect.
