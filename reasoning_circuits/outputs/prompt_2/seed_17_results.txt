<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to find the probability that at least two people in a group of five were born in the same month. Hmm, this seems like a problem related to combinatorics and probability. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should recall that months on a calendar are 12, so each person's birthday is associated with one of these months. Now, the question is about the probability that at least two people share the same birth month. I know that sometimes in probability, it's easier to calculate the complement probability and then subtract it from 1. The complement of "at least two people have the same birth month" is "all five people have different birth months."

So, let me try that approach. I'll calculate the probability that all five people have different birth months and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least two share a month.

To calculate the probability that all five people have different birth months, I can think about the number of ways this can happen divided by the total number of possible ways the birthdays can occur.

Let me start with the total number of possible birthday combinations. Since there are 12 months, for each person, there are 12 possible birth months. So, for five people, the total number of possible combinations would be 12 multiplied by itself five times, which is \(12^5\). Let me compute that:

\(12^5 = 12 \times 12 \times 12 \times 12 \times 12\). Calculating that step by step:

- \(12 \times 12 = 144\)
- \(144 \times 12 = 1728\)
- \(1728 \times 12 = 20736\)
- \(20736 \times 12 = 248832\)

So, the total number of possible birthday combinations is 248,832.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes where all five people have different birth months. Let me think about how this can happen. For the first person, they can be born in any month, so 12 possibilities. For the second person, since we want a different month, they have 11 choices. Similarly, the third person has 10 choices, the fourth 9, and the fifth person 8 choices.

So, the number of ways all five birthdays can be different is \(12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8\). Let me calculate that:

First, let's compute \(12 \times 11 = 132\).

Then, \(132 \times 10 = 1320\).

Next, \(1320 \times 9 = 11,880\).

Finally, \(11,880 \times 8 = 95,040\).

Therefore, there are 95,040 different birthday combinations where all five have unique birth months.

So, the probability that all five birthdays are different is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

\[
P(\text{all different}) = \frac{95,040}{248,832}
\]

Now, I need to simplify this fraction. Let me see if I can divide numerator and denominator by common factors. Both are divisible by 48, I think. Let me check:

Dividing numerator and denominator by 48:

Numerator: 95,040 ÷ 48. Let's see:

48 × 2000 = 96,000, which is a bit more than 95,040. So, 48 × 1980 = ?

Wait, maybe a different approach: Let me use prime factors.

Factorizing 95,040:

95,040 can be written as 95,040 = 95,040.

Divide by 10: 9,504

Factor into prime factors:

9,504: divide by 2: 4,752

Again by 2: 2,376

Again by 2: 1,188

Again by 2: 594

Again by 2: 297

297 is 3 × 99, which is 3 × 3 × 33, which is 3 × 3 × 3 × 11.

So overall, 95,040 factors into \(2^6 \times 3^3 \times 5 \times 11\).

Similarly, factorizing 248,832.

Divide 248,832 by 10: 24,883.2, not integer.

So, maybe I'll divide by 2 until it's not even:

248,832 ÷ 2 = 124,416

124,416 ÷ 2 = 62,208

62,208 ÷ 2 = 31,104

31,104 ÷ 2 = 15,552

15,552 ÷ 2

<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that probability questions can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to "at least" scenarios. Often, it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. So, in this case, instead of calculating the probability that at least 2 people share a birth month, maybe I can calculate the probability that all 5 people have different birth months and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the desired probability.

Alright, let's break it down. The question is about 5 people, and I assume each person can be born in any of the 12 months, right? So, each person has 12 possible birth months, and they are independent of each other. So, for the first person, there are 12 possibilities, the second person also has 12, and so on.

But when we're dealing with probabilities where order doesn't matter, like the order of birth months, we should consider permutations or combinations. Hmm, wait, in this case, since each person is a distinct individual, the order does matter in the sense that each person has their own birth month. But when calculating probabilities where each event is independent, the multiplication principle applies. So, maybe I can think of it as 12 choices for the first person, 12 for the second, and so on.

But actually, no, that might not be the correct approach. Because when we're looking for the probability that all 5 people have different birth months, we need to think about the number of ways to assign different months to each person, divided by the total number of possible assignments.

So, let's formalize this. The total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people is 12^5, since each person can be born in any of the 12 months. That makes sense.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes where all 5 people have different birth months would be the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time. That is, 12P5, which is calculated as 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me compute that: 12 × 11 is 132, times 10 is 1320, times 9 is 11880, times 8 is 95040. So, there are 95,040 favorable outcomes where all 5 have different birth months.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 have different birth months is 95040 divided by 12^5. Let's compute 12^5: 12 × 12 is 144, times 12 is 1728, times 12 is 20736, times 12 is 248832. So, 12^5 is 248,832.

So, the probability that all 5 people have different birth months is 95040 / 248832. Let me compute that fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 95040: 95040 ÷ 95040 is 1, and 248832 ÷ 95040 is approximately 2.622. Wait, let me do it more accurately.

Alternatively, let me divide numerator and denominator by 48: 95040 ÷ 48 is 1980, and 248832 ÷ 48 is 5184. So, 1980 / 5184. Hmm, can we divide by 12? 1980 ÷12 is 165, 5184 ÷12 is 432. So, 165 / 432. Hmm, can we divide by 3? 165 ÷3 is 55, 432 ÷3 is 144. So, 55 / 144. That can't be reduced further. So, the probability is 55/144.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Because 95040 divided by 248832. Let me see, 95040 × 2 is 190080, subtract that from 248832: 248832 - 190080 = 58752. So, it's 2 and 58752/248832. Simplify 58752/248832: divide numerator and denominator by 48: 58752 ÷48 is 1224, 248832 ÷48 is 5184. So, 1224 /5184. Divide by 12: 1224 ÷12 is 102, 5184 ÷12 is 432. So, 102 /432. Divide by 6: 102 ÷6 is 17, 432 ÷6 is 72. So,
