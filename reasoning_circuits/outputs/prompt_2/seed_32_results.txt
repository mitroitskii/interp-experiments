<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I've been given this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, maybe I can use that approach here.

First, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes. Since we're dealing with people's birthdays, which are monthly, each person can be born in any of the 12 months. So, for each person, there are 12 possible outcomes. Since there are 5 people, and each person's birthday is independent of the others, the total number of possible combinations should be 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, right? So, that would be 12^5. Let me check that: yes, because for each additional person, there are 12 more possibilities. So, 12*12*12*12*12 = 12^5. Let me compute what 12^5 is. 12 squared is 144, 12 cubed is 1728, 12 to the fourth is 20736, and 12 to the fifth is 248832. So, total possible outcomes are 248,832.

Now, I need the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways that at least 2 people were born in the same month. Hmm, but calculating "at least 2" directly might be a bit tricky. Maybe it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event, i.e., the probability that all 5 people were born in different months, and then subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability. Yeah, that sounds like a common approach in probability, avoiding having to calculate multiple cases.

Okay, so if all 5 people were born in different months, how many ways can that happen? Well, since there are 12 months, and we have 5 people, it's similar to permutations. For the first person, there are 12 possible months, for the second person, there are 11 remaining months, for the third person, 10, and so on. So, that would be 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. Let me compute that. 12*11 is 132, 132*10 is 1320, 1320*9 is 11,880, and 11,880*8 is 95,040. So, 95,040 ways for all five to be born in different months.

Wait, so the number of ways all birthdays are unique is 12P5 = 95,040. Therefore, the probability that all 5 birthdays are different is 95,040 divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 248,832. Let me calculate that fraction. 95,040 divided by 248,832. Hmm, I can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 48, I think.

Let me check: 95,040 divided by 48. Well, 48*2000 is 96,000, which is a bit more than 95,040. Hmm, maybe another common divisor. Let's see, 24? 24*95,040 is 24*(95,040). Wait, that might not help. Maybe I should compute 95,040 divided by 248,832.

Alternatively, I can compute the decimal value. 95,040 divided by 248,832. Let me see, 248,832 divided by 2 is 124,416. 95,040 is less than that. So, 95,040 ÷ 248,832 is approximately 0.381, since 0.381*248,832 is roughly 248,832*0.4 is about 99,333.6, which is a bit higher than 95,040. Maybe around 0.381?

Wait, maybe an exact fraction is better. Let me see, 95,040 and 248,832. Both numbers are divisible by 48. Let's check that: 48*95,040: 48*95,040. 48*90,000 is 4,320,000, and 48*5,040 is 241,920. So total is 4,320,000 + 241,920 = 4,561,920. Hmm, not sure. Wait, perhaps another way.

Wait, 12^5 is 248,832. 12P5 is 95,040. So, 95,040 / 248,832. Let me see if I can simplify the fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 48:

Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that probability problems often involve figuring out the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. In this case, the problem is about birthdays, so I guess we're talking about months as the possible outcomes. There are 12 months, right? So each person's birthday can be considered as one of 12 possibilities.

Now, the question is about the probability that at least 2 people were born in the same month. Hmm, "at least 2" means that there's a possibility of 2, 3, 4, or all 5 people sharing the same birth month. Calculating the probability for each of these cases separately might be complicated because there are so many different scenarios. Instead, maybe I can use the complementary probability approach. That is, instead of calculating the probability of at least 2 people sharing a birthday, I can calculate the probability that no two people share a birthday, and then subtract that from 1.

Yeah, that sounds like a better approach. So, the probability of at least 2 people sharing a birthday is equal to 1 minus the probability that all five people have unique birth months. Let me write that down:

P(at least 2 share) = 1 - P(all unique)

Alright, now I need to calculate P(all unique). So, how do I compute the probability that all five birthdays are in different months? I think this is similar to permutations because the order doesn't matter here—just the uniqueness of the birthdays.

For the first person, the probability of being born in any month is 1, since there's no restriction. For the second person, to have a unique birthday, they must be born in one of the remaining 11 months. For the third person, it's 10 months, and so on.

So, the probability that all five have unique birthdays is:

P(all unique) = (12/12) * (11/12) * (10/12) * (9/12) * (8/12)

Wait, let me make sure. So, for the first person, it's 12/12 = 1, which makes sense. The second person can't be in the same month as the first, so 11/12. The third person can't be in the same month as the first two, so 10/12, and so on until the fifth person, who has 8/12 probability.

So, multiplying those fractions together gives me the probability that all birthdays are unique. Let me compute that:

First, multiply the numerators: 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8
That's 12 * 11 = 132
132 * 10 = 1320
1320 * 9 = 11880
11880 * 8 = 95040

Now, the denominators: 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 = 12^5
12^5 is 12 * 12 = 144; 144 * 12 = 1728; 1728 * 12 = 20736; 20736 * 12 = 248832

So, P(all unique) = 95040 / 248832

Let me simplify that fraction. Let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by 48.

95040 ÷ 48 = 1980
248832 ÷ 48 = 5184

Hmm, 1980 and 5184. Maybe they can be divided by 12 again.

1980 ÷12= 165
5184 ÷12= 432

165 and 432. Let's try dividing by 3.

165 ÷3=55
432 ÷3=144

So, now we have 55/144.

Is that the simplest form? Let me check. 55 is 5*11, 144 is 12 squared, which is 2^4*3^2. There are no common factors between 55 and 144, so yes, 55/144 is the simplified fraction.

So, P(all unique) = 55/144

Therefore, P(at least 2 share) = 1 - 55/144

Calculating that: 1 is 144/144, so 144/144 - 55/144 = 89/144

Hmm, so the probability is 89/144. Let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, 144 is 12 choose 5? No, wait, 12^5 is 248832, which is much larger. Hmm
