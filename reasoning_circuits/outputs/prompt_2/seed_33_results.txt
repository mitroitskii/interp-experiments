Okay, so I have this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I remember probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to combinatorics, but I think I can handle this by breaking it down.

First off, let me rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. We have a group of 5 people, and we want to find the probability that at least 2 of them were born in the same month. So, the events we're looking at are whether two or more people share a birth month, and we need to calculate the probability of that happening.

I think the key here is that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event in this case would be that no two people were born in the same month, meaning all 5 people have unique birth months. So, if I can find the probability that all 5 have different birth months, then subtracting that probability from 1 should give me the desired probability.

But wait, how many months are there? Well, a year has 12 months, right? So, the possible months range from January (1) to December (12). Therefore, each person has 12 possible birth months. If we think about assigning birth months to each person, it's like dealing with permutations since the order might matter here—though, in probability, sometimes order doesn't matter. I need to clarify that.

Let me consider each person as an independent individual who can be born in any of the 12 months. Since we're dealing with multiple people, this sounds like a problem that involves combinations and permutations. So, for probability, the general approach is to find the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

First, let's consider the total number of possible outcomes. Each person has 12 choices regarding their birth month, and since the births are independent, we can multiply the number of choices for each person. So, for 5 people, the total number of possible combinations of birth months would be 12^5. Let me compute that: 12 multiplied by itself 5 times.

12^5 is 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12.

Calculating step by step:

12 * 12 = 144

144 * 12 = 1728

1728 * 12 = 20736

20736 * 12 = 248832

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again.

Wait, no: 12^1 = 12

12^2 = 144

12^3 = 12*144 = 1728

12^4 = 12*1728 = 20736

12^5 = 12*20736 = 248,832

Yes, that's correct. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 248,832.

Now, let's think about the number of favorable outcomes where at least 2 people were born in the same month. That seems a bit complex because "at least 2" includes several scenarios: exactly 2, exactly 3, exactly 4, or all 5 being born in the same month. Calculating each of these might be possible, but it's going to involve combinations for each case.

Alternatively, as I thought earlier, it's often easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is that no two people share the same birth month, and then subtract that probability from 1.

Let's try that approach. So, the complementary probability P(complement) is the probability that all 5 people have different birth months. To calculate this, we can use permutations because the order in which the months are assigned doesn't matter. So, for the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, to have a different month, there are 11 remaining months. For the third person, 10 months, and so on.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes where all 5 have different birth months is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

Let me compute that: 12 * 11 is 132, 132 * 10 is 1320, 1320 * 9 is 11,880, and 11,880 * 8 is 95,040. So, there are 95,040 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability P(complement) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 95,040 / 248,832.

Simplifying this fraction: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 48 to see if it reduces.

95,040

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps. The question is asking about the probability that at least two people share the same birth month. Since it's about months, there are 12 possible months, right? So each person can be born in one of 12 months.

I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving combinations, it's often useful to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be that no two people share the same birth month, meaning all five people have unique birth months. So if I can find the probability of all five being born in different months, I can subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least two share a month.

Alright, so let's denote the probability that all five people have unique birth months as P(unique). Then, the probability we're looking for is P(at least 2 same) = 1 - P(unique). That makes sense.

Now, how do I calculate P(unique)? Well, for the first person, there are 12 possible months they could be born in. For the second person, since we want them to be born in a different month, there are 11 remaining months. Similarly, the third person would have 10 possible months, the fourth person 9, and the fifth person 8. So, the number of favorable outcomes for all five having unique months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

But wait, I also need to consider the total number of possible outcomes for the five people's birth months. Since each person has 12 possibilities, the total number of possible combinations is 12^5. So, P(unique) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

Let me write that down:

P(unique) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / (12^5)

Hmm, let me compute that. First, let's calculate the numerator: 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. I can compute this step by step.

12 × 11 is 132.

132 × 10 is 1320.

1320 × 9 is... let's see, 1320 × 10 is 13200, minus 1320 is 11880.

11880 × 8 is... 11880 × 10 is 118800, minus 11880 × 2 which is 23760, so 118800 - 23760 = 95040.

So the numerator is 95040.

Now, the denominator is 12^5. Let me compute that. 12^2 is 144, 12^3 is 144 × 12 = 1728, 12^4 is 1728 × 12 = 20736, and 12^5 is 20736 × 12. Let me compute that: 20736 × 10 is 207360, plus 20736 × 2 is 41472, so adding those gives 207360 + 41472 = 248832.

So, the denominator is 248832.

Therefore, P(unique) = 95040 / 248832.

Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 95040, but let me see if I can divide numerator and denominator by smaller numbers first. Let's see, 95040 ÷ 95040 is 1, and 248832 ÷ 95040 is approximately 2.62... Hmm, that might not be helpful. Maybe I can factor both numbers to see if there's a common factor.

Let's factor numerator and denominator:

95040: Let's divide by 10 first: 95040 = 9504 × 10 = (9504) × (2 × 5). Now factor 9504: 9504 ÷ 2 = 4752, ÷2 again is 2376, ÷2 is 1188, ÷2 is 594, ÷2 is 297. So 95040 = 2^5 × 5 × 297.

297 is 99 × 3, and 99 is 9 × 11, so 297 = 3^3 × 11. Therefore, 95040 = 2^5 × 3^3 × 5 × 11.

Now, let's factor 248832.

248832 ÷ 2 = 124416

124416 ÷ 2 = 62108

62108 ÷
