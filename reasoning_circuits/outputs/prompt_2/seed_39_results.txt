<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I've got this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step. I might get confused at times, but I'll try to work it out.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have 5 people, and we need to find the probability that at least two of them were born in the same month. It doesn't specify which months, just that at least two share a month. So, that means we're looking for the probability that in this group of five, there are no people sharing a birth month, and then subtracting that from 1 to get the probability that at least two do share a month.

Okay, so to calculate probabilities involving combinations, it's often useful to use the concept of combinations and perhaps the formula for permutations or probabilities in that vein. So, since the question is about the probability of at least two people sharing a month, it's a "complementary probability" scenario. That is, the probability that all five people have distinct birth months is easier to calculate, and then subtract that probability from 1.

So, let me denote:

- P(At least two share a month) = 1 - P(All have distinct months)

Yes, that seems correct. So, if I can find the probability that all five people have distinct birth months, then subtract that from 1, I'll have the desired probability.

Alright, so to compute P(All have distinct months), we can use the concept of permutations. Let's think about the months. How many months are there? Well, assuming we're talking about the regular 12 months of the year. So, 12 months.

If we have 5 people and we want each to be born in a different month, we can think of it as assigning a month to each person such that no two people share the same month. So, for the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, since one month is already taken by the first person, there are 11 remaining months. For the third person, 10 months, and so on.

So, the number of favorable outcomes would be 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Because for each subsequent person, one month is eliminated. So, that's 12P5, which is the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time.

On the other hand, the total number of possible outcomes for the birth months of 5 people is 12^5, since each person can be born in any of the 12 months independently.

Therefore, the probability that all five people have distinct birth months is:

P(All distinct) = (12P5) / (12^5)

So, let me compute that. First, compute 12P5. Let's calculate that:

12P5 = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8

Let me compute that step by step.

12 × 11 = 132

132 × 10 = 1320

1320 × 9 = 11880

11880 × 8 = 95040

So, 12P5 = 95040.

Then, 12^5: let's compute that as well.

12^1 = 12

12^2 = 144

12^3 = 1728

12^4 = 20736

12^5 = 248832

So, P(All distinct) = 95040 / 248832

Let me compute that division.

First, let's see if we can simplify the fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 95040:

95040 / 95040 = 1

248832 / 95040. Let's compute that.

Divide 248832 by 95040:

Well, 95040 × 2 = 190080

Subtract that from 248832: 248832 - 190080 = 58752

Now, 58752 ÷ 95040.

95040 ÷ 58752 = approximately 1.618, but perhaps we can find a common divisor.

Wait, perhaps it's better to reduce the fraction step by step.

Let's try to divide both numerator and denominator by 48.

95040 ÷ 48 = 95040 / 48. 95040 ÷ 48. Let's compute 95040 ÷ 12 first: 95040 ÷ 12 = 7920. Then, 7920 ÷ 4 = 1980. So, 48 × 1980 = 95040.

Similarly, 248832 ÷ 48. Let's compute 248832 ÷

<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to figuring out the right approach. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving "at least" or "at most," it can be helpful to consider the complementary probability. So, instead of calculating the probability that at least two people share a birth month directly, maybe I can find the probability that no two people share a birth month and subtract that from 1. That seems like a good plan because sometimes it's easier to calculate the complement.

So, the probability we're looking for is P(at least 2 born in the same month) = 1 - P(all born in different months). Cool, so I need to figure out P(all born in different months).

Now, let's think about the months. There are 12 months in a year, right? So, if we have 5 people and we want each one to be born in a different month, we need to assign each person a unique month out of the 12.

This seems like a permutation problem. Specifically, the number of ways to choose 5 different months out of 12 and assign them to the 5 people. The formula for permutations is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, where n is the total number of things to choose from, and k is the number of things to choose.

So, in this case, n is 12 months and k is 5 people. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is P(12, 5) = 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7!.

But wait, I should also consider the total number of possible outcomes for the birthdays. Each person can be born in any of the 12 months, and since the birthdays are independent, the total number of possible combinations is 12^5.

So, putting it all together, the probability that all 5 people were born in different months is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That is:

P(all different) = P(12, 5) / 12^5 = (12! / 7!) / 12^5.

Therefore, the probability we want is:

P(at least 2 same month) = 1 - (12! / 7!) / 12^5.

Hmm, okay. Let me write that out more clearly.

Total number of possible birthday combinations: 12^5.

Number of ways all 5 can be in different months: 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. That's because for the first person, there are 12 choices, the next person has 11 remaining months, then 10, and so on until the fifth person has 8 choices.

So, calculating that, 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 = 95040.

Wait, let me check that multiplication:

12 × 11 = 132

132 × 10 = 1320

1320 × 9 = 11880

11880 × 8 = 95040. Yep, that's correct.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is 95040.

Total possible outcomes: 12^5. Let me calculate that.

12^5 = 12 × 12 × 12 × 12 × 12.

12 × 12 = 144

144 × 12 = 1728

1728 × 12 = 20736

20736 × 12 = 248832.

Wait, hold on, 12^5 is 248832? Let me confirm that:

12^1 = 12

12^2 = 144

12^3 = 1728

12^4 = 20736

12^5 = 248832. Yeah, that's right.

So, P(all different) = 95040 / 248832.

Now, let's simplify that fraction.

First, let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by 95040.

95040 goes into 248832 how many times? Let me divide 248832 by 95040.

248832 ÷ 95040 = approximately 2.62. Hmm, not a whole number, so maybe we can find a common divisor.

Alternatively, let's factor both numbers.

95040: Let's factor it.

95040 ÷ 10 = 9504

9504 ÷ 2 = 4752

4752 ÷ 2 = 2376

2376 ÷ 2 = 1188

1188 ÷ 2 =
