<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, sounds interesting. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that probability questions can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with "at least" conditions. Often, it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. So, in this case, instead of directly finding the probability that at least two people share a birth month, maybe I should find the probability that all five people have different birth months and then subtract that from 1. That seems like a plan.

Now, to find the probability that all five people have different birth months, I need to figure out two things: the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes. Then, probability is just the favorable divided by the total.

Let's start with the total number of possible outcomes. Since each person can be born in any month, and there are 12 months, for each person, there are 12 possibilities. But since we're dealing with multiple people, we need to consider the number of ways each person can be assigned a month. Since the order matters here—i.e., the first person's month can be any of 12, the second person's month can be any of 12, regardless of the first, because months are different—this seems like a permutations problem. So, it's 12 choices for the first person, multiplied by 12 for the second, 12 for the third, and so on.

Wait, no, actually, wait a minute. No, no, hold on. Because, for each additional person, their birth month can overlap with any of the previous months. But for the probability, since each person is independent, the total number of possible outcomes is actually 12 multiplied by itself 5 times. So, 12^5. Yeah, that makes sense because each of the five people has 12 independent choices for their birth month.

So, total outcomes = 12^5.

Now, for the favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways all five people can have different birth months. So, for this, it's like a permutation problem without repetition. The first person can be born in any of the 12 months, the second person must be born in a different month, so 11 choices, the third person has 10 choices, the fourth has 9, and the fifth has 8. So, this would be 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Alternatively, that can be written as 12P5, which is the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time.

Alternatively, I can write this as 12! / (12-5)! = 12! / 7!.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is 12P5 = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me calculate that. 12 × 11 is 132, ×10 is 1320, ×9 is 11880, ×8 is 95040. So, 95040 favorable outcomes where all five have different months.

Therefore, the probability that all five people have different birth months is 95040 divided by 12^5.

Let me compute 12^5. 12 × 12 is 144, ×12 is 1728, ×12 is 20736, ×12 is 248832. So, 12^5 is 248,832.

So, the probability that all five have different months is 95,040 / 248,832. Hmm, let me simplify that fraction.

First, let's see if both numbers are divisible by 48. 95,040 divided by 48 is 95,040 ÷ 48. Well, 48 × 2000 is 96,000, which is a bit higher, so 48 × 1980 is 48 × 1980, let me compute 48 × 2000 = 96,000; subtract 48 × 20 = 960, so 96,000 - 960 = 95,040. So, 1980.

Similarly, 248,832 ÷ 48: 48 × 5000 is 240,000, subtract that, get 8,832. Then, 48 × 180 is 8,640, subtract that, get 192. 48 × 4 is 192, so 5000 + 180 + 4 = 5184.

So, 95,040 / 248,832 reduces to 1980 / 5184.

Now, let's see if these can be simplified further. 1980 and

Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that probability questions often involve figuring out the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes would be the number of ways 5 people can be born in different months, right? Wait, no, actually, the opposite. Because we want the probability that at least 2 are born in the same month. So, maybe it's easier to calculate the probability that no two people share the same birth month and then subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.

Yeah, that seems like a good approach. So, the probability of at least 2 sharing a birth month is 1 minus the probability that all 5 people have distinct birth months.

Alright, so let's break it down. First, I need to figure out the probability that all 5 people have different birth months. To do that, I need to know how many months are there? Well, there are 12 months in a year, right? So, the number of possible birth months is 12.

So, if I have 5 people, and each person's birth month is independent, then the probability that all 5 have different months is the number of ways to assign different months divided by the total number of possible assignments.

Wait, let me clarify. For the first person, they can be born in any of the 12 months. For the second person, to have a different month from the first, they have 11 choices. The third person would have 10 choices, and so on. So, the number of favorable outcomes for all different months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

But actually, since the order of selection doesn't matter here—because we're just looking for any group of 5 people with different months—the number of ways should be a combination, not a permutation. Hmm, wait, no, because each person is a distinct individual, so the order does matter in a way. Or does it? Let me think.

If we're just counting the number of possible birth month assignments, considering that each person can be assigned any month, it's a permutation problem because the order matters in terms of assignment. But actually, no, because we're just assigning months to each person, so it's like arranging months in order. So, the first person has 12 choices, the next has 11, etc., which is 12P5, the permutation of 12 months taken 5 at a time.

So, the total number of possible assignments is 12^5, since each person independently can be born in any of the 12 months. So, the probability that all 5 have different months is 12P5 divided by 12^5.

Wait, let me write that down:

Probability(all different) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / (12^5)

Then, the probability(at least 2 same) = 1 - Probability(all different).

Let me compute that.

First, let me compute the numerator: 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

12 × 11 is 132, 132 × 10 is 1320, 1320 × 9 is 11880, 11880 × 8 is 95040.

So, numerator is 95040.

Denominator is 12^5. Let me compute 12^5.

12^2 is 144, 12^3 is 1728, 12^4 is 20736, 12^5 is 248832.

So, the probability(all different) is 95040 / 248832.

Let me simplify that fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 95040: 95040 ÷ 95040 = 1, and 248832 ÷ 95040 = 2.62... Wait, that's not helpful.

Maybe divide both by 48: 95040 ÷ 48 = 1980, 248832 ÷ 48 = 5184.

So, 1980 / 5184. Hmm, can we divide further?

Divide by 12: 1980 ÷12=165, 5184 ÷12=432.

165 / 432. Divide by 3: 55 / 144.

So, 55/144 is approximately 0.3819.

So, Probability(all different) ≈ 0.3819, which means Probability(at least 2 same) = 1 - 0.3819 ≈ 0.6181.

Wait,
