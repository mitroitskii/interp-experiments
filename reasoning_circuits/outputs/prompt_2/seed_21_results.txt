<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that at least two people out of five were born in the same month. Hmm, where do I start? Well, probability problems often involve figuring out the total number of possible outcomes and then the number of favorable outcomes. 

First, let me consider the total number of possible outcomes. Since we're dealing with people's birth months, there are 12 months in a year. That means each person can be born in any of the 12 months. So, for five people, the total number of possible combinations of birth months would be 12 multiplied by itself five times, right? That is \(12^5\). Let me calculate that: \(12 \times 12 \times 12 \times 12 \times 12\). Hmm, \(12^2\) is 144, \(12^3\) is 1728, \(12^4\) is 20736, and \(12^5\) is 248832. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 248,832.

Now, I need the number of favorable outcomes where at least two people share the same birth month. Hmm, 'at least two' means either exactly two, exactly three, up to all five being born in the same month. Calculating all these scenarios separately might get complicated, but I remember something about complementary probability. Instead of calculating the probability of at least two directly, maybe I can calculate the probability of the opposite event and subtract it from 1.

What's the opposite event? It's the probability that no two people share the same birth month. That is, all five people are born in different months. Is that possible? Let's see. Since there are 12 months, we can have at most 12 people each born in a unique month. Since we have only five people, it's definitely possible. So, the number of ways this can happen is the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time, which is \(P(12,5)\).

Calculating \(P(12,5)\). That should be 12 choices for the first person, 11 for the second, 10 for the third, 9 for the fourth, and 8 for the fifth. So, \(12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8\). Let me compute that step by step:

12 x 11 is 132,
132 x 10 is 1320,
1320 x 9 is 11,880,
11,880 x 8 is 95,040.

So, there are 95,040 ways where all five are born in different months.

Therefore, the probability that all five are born in different months is the number of such favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 95,040 / 248,832.

Let me simplify that fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 48. 95,040 ÷ 48 is 1,980, and 248,832 ÷ 48 is 5,184. So, now it's 1,980 / 5,184.

Hmm, can we simplify further? Let's see if both are divisible by 12. 1,980 ÷ 12 is 165, and 5,184 ÷ 12 is 432. So now it's 165 / 432.

165 and 432, do they have a common divisor? 3, I think. 165 ÷ 3 is 55, and 432 ÷ 3 is 144. So now, the probability is 55 / 144.

Is that reducible further? 55 factors are 5 and 11, 144 factors are 2^4 and 3^2. So, no, 55/144 is the simplified fraction. Let me convert that to a decimal to get a better sense. 55 divided by 144. Let's see, 144 goes into 55 zero times. 144 goes into 550 three times (3*144=432). So 550 - 432=118. Bring down a zero: 1180. 144 goes into 1180 eight times (8*144=1,152). So, 1180 - 1152=28. Bring down a zero: 280. 144 goes into 280 once (1*144=144). 280 - 144=136. Bring down a zero: 1360. 144 goes into 1360 nine times (9*144=1,296). 1360 - 1296=64. So, I have 0.3819... approximately. So, about 38.19% chance.

Therefore, the probability that all five are born in different

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that at least two people out of five were born in the same month. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I know that probability problems often involve figuring out the total number of possible outcomes and then the number of favorable outcomes. So, I guess I need to calculate the total number of ways five people can be born in different months and then subtract that from the total number of possible birth month combinations to find the probability of at least two people sharing a birth month.

Let me start by understanding the problem better. There are 12 months in a year, so each person has 12 possible birth months. Since we're dealing with five people, the total number of possible combinations of their birth months is 12 multiplied by itself five times, which is 12^5. Let me write that down:

Total number of possible outcomes = 12^5.

Now, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes where at least two people share the same birth month. Instead of calculating this directly, it might be easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event, where all five people have different birth months, and then subtract that from 1. That is, P(at least two share) = 1 - P(all different). 

Okay, so let me calculate the number of ways all five can have different birth months. For the first person, they can be born in any of the 12 months. For the second person, to have a different birth month than the first, there are 11 choices. For the third person, 10 choices, and so on, down to 8 choices for the fifth person.

So, the number of ways all five can be born in different months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me compute that:

12 × 11 = 132,
132 × 10 = 1320,
1320 × 9 = 11880,
11880 × 8 = 95040.

So, there are 95,040 ways for all five to have different birth months.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for the complementary event (all different) is 95,040. So, the probability of all five having different birth months is 95,040 divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 12^5.

Let me calculate 12^5 first:

12^2 = 144,
12^3 = 144 × 12 = 1728,
12^4 = 1728 × 12 = 20736,
12^5 = 20736 × 12 = 248,832.

So, total number of possible outcomes is 248,832.

Now, the probability that all five have different birth months is 95,040 / 248,832.

Let me compute that fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 95,040 ÷ 48 = 1980; 248,832 ÷ 48 = 5184.

So, 1980 / 5184. Hmm, can we simplify this further? Let me divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1980 ÷ 12 = 165; 5184 ÷ 12 = 432.

165 / 432. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3: 165 ÷ 3 = 55; 432 ÷ 3 = 144.

So, 55 / 144. That's approximately 0.3819, or 38.19%.

So, the probability that all five have different birth months is about 38.19%. Therefore, the probability that at least two share a birth month is 1 - 0.3819 = 0.6181, or 61.81%.

Wait, but let me verify my calculations because 95,040 divided by 248,832. Let me compute that as a decimal to check.

95,040 ÷ 248,832. Let's see:

248,832 goes into 95,040 how many times? Well, 248,832 is larger than 95,040, so it's less than 1. Let me compute 95,040 ÷ 248,832.

Let me divide numerator and denominator by 48 as I did before: 95,040 ÷ 48 = 1980; 248,832 ÷ 48 = 5184.

So, 1980 / 5184. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1980 ÷ 12 = 165; 5184 ÷ 12 = 432.

165 / 432. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 55 / 144 ≈ 0.3819.

Yes, that's correct. So, 1 - 0.3819
