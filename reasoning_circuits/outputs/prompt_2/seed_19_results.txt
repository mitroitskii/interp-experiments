<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to find the probability that at least 2 people out of 5 were born in the same month. Hmm, okay. Probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this by breaking it down step by step.

First, let me understand what's being asked. We have 5 people, and we need to figure out the probability that at least two were born in the same month. "At least two" means that either exactly two were born in the same month, exactly three, four, or all five. That seems like a lot to cover, but maybe there's an easier way to think about it.

I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtracting it from 1. The complementary event of "at least two born in the same month" would be "no two people are born in the same month," which means all five people were born in different months. That might be simpler because we can use the multiplication principle instead of adding up all the possibilities for two, three, four, or five people sharing a month.

So, let's rephrase: what's the probability that all five people were born in different months? Then, subtract that probability from 1 to get the desired result.

But before I proceed, let me confirm: does the question specify anything about the distribution of birth months? It just says "in a group of 5 people," so I guess the months are equally likely, right? There are 12 months in a year, so each person has an equal chance of being born in any month. So, it's a question of distributing 5 people into 12 months without any overlap.

Okay, so to find the probability that all five people have distinct birth months, I can calculate it as follows:

1. The first person can be born in any month, so the probability is 1 (or 12/12, since there are 12 months).
2. The second person must be born in a different month than the first. Since the first person took up one month, there are 11 months left. So, the probability is 11/12.
3. The third person must be born in a different month than the first two. That leaves 10 months, so the probability is 10/12.
4. The fourth person has 9 months left, so probability 9/12.
5. The fifth person has 8 months left, so probability 8/12.

Since each person is independent of the others, we can multiply these probabilities together to find the probability that all five have different birth months:

P(all different) = (12/12) * (11/12) * (10/12) * (9/12) * (8/12)

Simplify that:

12/12 is 1, so we can ignore that. Then,

P(all different) = 1 * (11/12) * (10/12) * (9/12) * (8/12)
= (11*10*9*8)/(12^4)
But 12^4 is 12*12*12*12, which is 20736

Calculate the numerator: 11*10 = 110, 110*9=990, 990*8=7920

So, P(all different) = 7920 / 20736

Hmm, let me see if this can be simplified. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 48: 7920 ÷ 48 = 165, and 20736 ÷ 48 = 432.

So that gives 165/432. Hmm, still reducible. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3: 165 ÷3 =55, 432 ÷3=144.

So, 55/144. Let me check if this can be simplified further. 55 is 5*11, and 144 is 12^2=16*9=2^4*3^2. No common factors, so 55/144 is the simplified fraction.

Therefore, P(all different) = 55/144

So, the probability that at least two people were born in the same month is 1 minus the probability that all five were born in different months. So,

P(at least two same) = 1 - P(all different)
= 1 - 55/144
= (144/144) - (55/144)
= 89/144

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Wait, 1 - 55/144 is (144 - 55)/144 = 89/144. Hmm, that seems low. Wait, 89 divided by 144 is approximately 0.62 or 62%, which seems kind of low for having at least two people

<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First off, I know that probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps. So, the question is about probability, specifically the chance that at least two people in a group of five share the same birth month. Hmm, "at least two" means that it's the complement of all five having different birth months. Wait, maybe I can use the complement rule here? Yeah, that might be easier because calculating the probability of all five being different could be straightforward, and then I can subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.

Okay, so let's denote the probability we want as P(at least two same month). Then, the complement event would be that all five people have different birth months. So, P(at least two same month) = 1 - P(all different months). That seems like a good plan.

Now, I need to figure out P(all different months). To do that, I should consider the number of possible birth month distributions and how many of those result in all five people having different months.

Wait, but how many months are there? A year has 12 months, right? So, each person can be born in any of the 12 months. So, for the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, also 12, but since we want all different, the second person can't be born in the same month as the first. So, 11 months left. Similarly, the third person has 10 months, the fourth has 9, and the fifth has 8. So, is that the number of favorable outcomes?

Wait, no. Hold on, that might be if we're considering the order, like permutations. But in probability, when we're dealing with independent events, the number of possible outcomes for each person is independent. So, maybe I should think in terms of probabilities multiplying.

Yeah, that's a better approach. So, for the first person, the probability of being born in any specific month is 1, since all months are possible. For the second person, the probability of not being born in the same month as the first is 11/12. For the third person, the probability of not being in any of the first two months is 10/12, and so on.

So, putting that together, P(all different months) would be (12/12) * (11/12) * (10/12) * (9/12) * (8/12). Hmm, that makes sense.

Wait, but let me write that out more clearly:

P(all different months) = (12/12) * (11/12) * (10/12) * (9/12) * (8/12)

Simplify that, it's (12!)/(12^5) where 12! is 12 factorial, but let me compute it step by step.

First, 12/12 is 1, so that term is 1. Then, 11/12 is approximately 0.9167, 10/12 is about 0.8333, 9/12 is 0.75, and 8/12 is approximately 0.6667.

So, multiplying these together: 1 * 0.9167 * 0.8333 * 0.75 * 0.6667.

Let me compute that:

0.9167 * 0.8333 ≈ 0.9167 * 0.8333 ≈ 0.9167 * (5/6) ≈ 0.9167 * 0.8333 ≈ Let me do it step by step.

0.9167 * 0.8333:

Multiply 9167 * 8333, but that's too big. Alternatively, 0.9167 is 11/12, and 0.8333 is 10/12, so 11/12 * 10/12 = 110/144. Similarly, 0.75 is 9/12, and 0.6667 is 8/12.

So, 110/144 * 9/12 * 8/12.

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 110 * 9 * 8

Denominator: 144 * 12 * 12

Compute numerator: 110 * 9 = 990, 990 * 8 = 7920

Denominator: 144 * 12 = 1728, 1728 * 12 = 20736

So, the probability is 7920 / 20736.
