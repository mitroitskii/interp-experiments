<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that probability is about the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So I need to figure out how many ways at least two people can be born in the same month, and then divide that by the total number of ways the five people can be born in any months.

Let me break it down. Let's assume that months are from 1 to 12, so there are 12 possible months. Each person's birthday can be in any of these months. Since we're dealing with people and months, this sounds like a problem where each person has 12 possible "spots," and we want to know the probability that two or more share the same spot.

Hmm, wait. The problem says "at least two were born in the same month." So that could be two, three, four, or all five being born in the same month. Calculating that directly might be a bit complicated, so maybe I can use the complement rule. Instead of calculating the probability of at least two sharing a month, I can calculate the probability that all five have distinct months, and then subtract that from 1. Yeah, that seems easier.

So the total number of possible birth month combinations for five people is 12^5, right? Because each person has 12 choices. So the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5.

Now, for the favorable outcomes where all five birthdays are in different months. Well, if each person has to be in a different month, that's similar to assigning each person a unique month from 1 to 12 without repetition. So that would be the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time. I remember permutations from combinatorics. The formula for permutations is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, so in this case, that would be P(12, 5) = 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7!.

So the number of favorable outcomes where all five have different months is 12! / 7!.

Therefore, the probability that all five have different birth months is (12! / 7!) divided by 12^5. Then the probability that at least two share a month is 1 minus that probability.

Wait, let me double-check this. So the total number of possible outcomes is indeed 12^5, because each person can be born in any of the 12 months, independently. So that's 12 multiplied by itself 5 times.

And for the favorable outcomes where all birthdays are distinct, we need to count the number of injective functions from the set of 5 people to the set of 12 months. Each person is assigned a unique month. So that's 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Which is 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7! as I thought earlier. So that part is correct.

So putting it together, the probability is 1 - (12! / 7!)/12^5. Hmm, that seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can compute it numerically.

Let me compute 12^5 first. 12 × 12 is 144, 144 × 12 is 1728, 1728 × 12 is 20736, 20736 × 12 is 248832. So 12^5 is 248,832.

Now, 12! is 479001600, and 7! is 5040. So 12! / 7! is 479001600 / 5040. Let me compute that. Dividing 479001600 by 5040.

Well, 5040 goes into 479001600 how many times? Let's see: 5040 × 90,000 is 453,600,000. Then 5040 × 95,000 is 5040 × 90,000 + 5040 × 5,000 = 453,600,000 + 25,200,000 = 478,800,000. So subtracting that from 479,001,600, we get 479,001,600 - 478,800,000 = 201,600.

Now, 5040 × 40 = 201,600. So total is 95,000 + 40 = 95,040. So 12! / 7! is 95,040.

Wait, that seems off. Because 12! / 7! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9

Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that probability questions can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to "at least" scenarios. I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. So, maybe I can use that approach here.

Let me define the problem more clearly. We have 5 people, and we want the probability that at least two of them share the same birth month. The opposite of this event would be that all 5 people have different birth months. So, if I can find the probability that all 5 have different months, I can subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.

But before I jump into calculations, I should consider the number of months in a year. There are 12 months, right? So, each person's birthday can be considered as a choice among 12 possibilities.

Wait, but when dealing with probabilities like this, especially with multiple events, it's often useful to think in terms of permutations or combinations. Let me recall: when arranging objects where order doesn't matter, we use combinations, but when order does matter, we use permutations.

In this case, the order of their birthdays doesn't matter, so I think combinations are the way to go. So, for the first person, there are 12 possible months they could be born in. For the second person, it's also 12, but since we don't want them to share the same month as the first person (in the case of all different months), it would be 11 for the second person.

Wait, hold on, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think about it more carefully.

If I want the number of ways all 5 people can have different birth months, that's like assigning each person a unique month. So, the first person can be born in any of the 12 months. The second person can be born in any of the remaining 11 months. The third person then has 10 options, the fourth 9, and the fifth 8.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes (all different months) is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me write that down:

Number of favorable outcomes = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

And the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways 5 people can be born in 12 months without any restrictions. That would be 12^5, since each person independently has 12 choices.

So, the probability that all 5 have different months is (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / (12^5). Then, the probability that at least two share the same month is 1 minus that.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

12 × 11 is 132.

132 × 10 is 1320.

1320 × 9 is... let's see, 1320 × 10 is 13200, minus 1320, so 13200 - 1320 = 11880.

11880 × 8 is... 11880 × 10 is 118800, minus 11880 × 2, which is 23760. So, 118800 - 23760 = 95040.

So, the numerator is 95040.

Now, the denominator is 12^5. Let's compute that.

12^2 is 144.

12^3 is 144 × 12. 144 × 10 is 1440, 144 × 2 is 288, so 1440 + 288 = 1728.

12^4 is 1728 × 12. 1728 × 10 is 17280, 1728 × 2 is 3456, so 17280 + 3456 = 20736.

12^5 is 20736 × 12. 20736 × 10 is 207360, 20736 × 2 is 41472, so 207360 + 41472 = 248832.

So, the denominator is 248832.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 have different months is 95040 / 248832.

Let me simplify that fraction. Both numbers are divisible by... let me see. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 95040 first.

95040 ÷ 95040 = 1.

248832 ÷ 95040. Let's see, 95040 × 2 = 190080, subtract
