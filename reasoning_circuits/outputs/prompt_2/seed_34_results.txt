<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that probability problems often involve figuring out the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. In this case, the total number of outcomes would be all the possible ways the 5 people can have their birth months arranged. Since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, that might be part of it.

Wait, actually, when dealing with birthdays, it's often modeled as 12 possibilities for each person, right? So for one person, the probability doesn't matter, but for multiple people, we can use combinations.

So, for 5 people, each having 12 possible birth months, the total number of possible combinations is 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 12^5. Let me write that down:

Total possible outcomes = 12^5

Now, the problem is asking for the probability that at least 2 people were born in the same month. Hmm, when I see "at least," sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be that no two people were born in the same month, meaning all 5 have unique birth months.

Okay, so let me find the probability that all 5 people have different birth months, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least 2 share a month.

To find the probability of all different months, I need the number of favorable outcomes where all 5 have unique months, divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

The number of favorable outcomes for all unique months is 12 choices for the first person, 11 for the second, 10 for the third, and so on until the fifth person has only 8 choices.

Wait, that sounds like a permutation. Yes, so that's P(12,5) or 12P5. So the number of ways is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

Calculating that: 12 * 11 is 132, 132 * 10 is 1320, 1320 * 9 is 11880, and 11880 * 8 is 95040. So there are 95040 favorable outcomes.

So the probability that all 5 have different birth months is 95040 / (12^5). Let's compute 12^5 first: 12*12=144, 144*12=1728, 1728*12=20736, 20736*12=248832. So 12^5 is 248832.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 have different months is 95040 / 248832. Let me calculate that fraction. First, divide numerator and denominator by 95040: 95040 ÷ 95040 =1, 248832 ÷95040= 2.63... Hmm, maybe it's easier to reduce the fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 95040 ÷48= 1980, 248832 ÷48= 5184.

Now divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1980 ÷12= 165, 5184 ÷12=432.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 165 ÷3=55, 432 ÷3=144.

So now we have 55/144. Let me see if this can be reduced further. 55 is 5*11 and 144 is 12 squared (2^4 *3^2). No common factors, so the simplified probability is 55/144.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 people have different birth months is 55/144. To find the probability that at least two share a month, we subtract this from 1.

So, Probability(at least 2 same month) = 1 - 55/144

Compute that: 1 is 144/144, so 144/144 -55/144 =89/144.

Wait, let me check 144 -55. 144-50=94, 94-5=89, yes, so it's 89/144.

Hmm, is that right? I think I might have made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check the number of favorable outcomes.

Earlier, I thought that 12P5 is 12*11*10*9*8. 12*11=132, 132*10=1320, 1320*9=11880, 11880*8=95040. Yes, that seems right.

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps. The question is about finding the probability that at least two people share the same birth month. That means I need to consider all possible ways this can happen and then figure out how likely it is compared to all possible outcomes.

I remember that for probability questions involving combinations, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event in this case would be that no two people share the same birth month, right? So, if I can find the probability that all five people have unique birth months, then subtracting that from 1 will give me the desired probability.

But wait, before diving into calculations, I should make sure about the number of months. A year has 12 months, right? So, the possible birth months are January to December, which is 12 months. So, the possible outcomes for each person's birth month are 12.

Okay, so let's formalize this. Let me denote the events where each person is born in a different month. Since we have 5 people, the number of ways they can all be born in different months is the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time. Wait, is that right?

No, hold on. Actually, the order in which they are born doesn't matter for probability purposes, unless specified. So, maybe it's better to think in terms of combinations instead of permutations. Hmm.

Let me recall the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, if I consider the first person, they can be born in any of the 12 months. The second person must be born in a different month, so they have 11 choices. The third person has 10 choices, and so on.

So, the total number of ways all 5 people can have unique birth months is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. That makes sense because it's like arranging 5 different months out of 12. So, that would be the number of favorable outcomes for the complementary event.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of combinations, the number of ways to choose 5 different months out of 12 is C(12, 5). Then, for each combination, the number of ways the 5 people can be assigned to those months is 5!, which is 120. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is C(12, 5) * 5!.

Wait, let me verify that. So, C(12, 5) is the number of ways to choose 5 months, and then for each group of 5 months, the number of ways to assign each person to a month is 5! since it's a permutation. So, yes, that seems correct. So, both approaches should give the same result.

Calculating that, C(12, 5) is 792. Then, 792 multiplied by 120 (which is 5!) is 792 * 120. Let me compute that: 792 * 100 is 79,200, and 792 * 20 is 15,840, so adding those together gives 79,200 + 15,840 = 95,040. So, the total number of favorable outcomes for the complementary event is 95,040.

Now, the total number of possible outcomes for the original problem is the number of ways 5 people can be born in 12 months without any restrictions. Since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5. Let me compute that: 12 * 12 is 144, 144 * 12 is 1,728, 1,728 * 12 is 20,736, and 20,736 * 12 is 248,832. So, total possible outcomes are 248,832.

So, the probability that all five people have unique birth months is the number of favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 95,040 / 248,832.

Let me compute that fraction. First, let's see if we can reduce it. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 48. 95,040 ÷ 48 is 1,980, and 248,832 ÷ 48 is 5,184. Hmm, still, maybe we can divide further. Let's see if both numbers are divisible
