<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that probability questions like this often involve combinations and understanding the total number of possible outcomes versus the number of favorable outcomes. So, maybe I should start by figuring out the total number of possible ways the 5 people could be born in different months.

Wait, but months are 12 in total, right? So, each person has 12 possible birth months. Since the births are independent, the total number of possible combinations would be 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 12^5. Let me calculate that: 12*12=144, 144*12=1728, 1728*12=20736, 20736*12=248832. So, the total number of possible birth month combinations is 248,832.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month. Hmm, "at least 2" could mean exactly 2, exactly 3, up to all 5 being in the same month. Calculating all these probabilities separately and adding them up seems complicated. I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1.

The complementary event here would be that no two people were born in the same month, meaning all 5 were born in different months. So, if I can find the probability that all 5 are born in different months, then subtract that from 1, I'll have the desired probability.

Alright, so let's calculate the number of ways all 5 can be born in different months. Since each person must have a unique birth month, and there are 12 months, it's like assigning each person a distinct month. This sounds like a permutation problem.

Wait, the first person can be born in any of the 12 months. The second person can't be born in the same month, so that's 11 choices. The third person has 10 choices, the fourth 9, and the fifth has 8. So, the total number of ways is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

Let me compute that: 12*11=132, 132*10=1320, 1320*9=11880, 11880*8=95040. So, 95,040 ways for all 5 to have unique birth months.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 are born in different months is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 95,040 / 248,832.

Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 48, I think. Wait, let me try smaller numbers. Let's see, divide numerator and denominator by 48:

95,040 ÷ 48 = 1975

Wait, 48 * 2000 is 96,000, which is a bit more than 95,040, so maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, let's divide numerator and denominator by 24: 95,040 ÷24= 3960, and 248,832 ÷24= 10,368.

Hmm, still not helpful. Maybe it's better to just compute the decimal value.

95,040 ÷ 248,832. Let me calculate that: 95,040 ÷ 248,832. Hmm, 248,832 goes into 95,040 less than once, so 0. Let me use decimal division. Let's express both as division: 95040 ÷ 248832.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to make it easier: 95,040,000 ÷ 248,832. Maybe that's still complicated.

Alternatively, let me divide both by 48: 95040 ÷48= 1980, and 248832 ÷48= 5184.

So, now it's 1980 / 5184. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 12: 165 / 432. Hmm, still not the simplest. Wait, divide by 3: 55 / 144.

So, the probability is 55/144, which is approximately 0.3819, or 38.19%.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 are born in different months is about 38.19%. So, the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month is 1 minus that, which is 1 - 0.3819 = 0.6181, or 61.81%.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's

Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down step by step usually helps. So, the problem is about 5 people and their birth months. We need to find the probability that at least two share the same birth month. That means either exactly two, exactly three, exactly four, or all five being born in the same month. 

But wait, calculating the probability for each of these cases separately might be complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. I remember something about using combinations and the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Or perhaps it's easier to calculate the complementary probability and then subtracting from 1.

Right, the complementary probability! That might be the way to go. The complementary event of "at least two born in the same month" is "all five people born in different months." So, if I can find the probability that all five are born in different months, then subtract that from 1, I'll have the desired probability.

Okay, so let's define the sample space. Each person can be born in any of the 12 months. So, for the first person, there are 12 possible months, the second person also has 12, and so on. But wait, since we are dealing with probabilities, we need to consider the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.

Wait, but since each person's birthday is independent, the total number of possible combinations is 12^5, right? Because each person has 12 choices, and there are 5 people, so 12*12*12*12*12.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes for all five being born in different months would be the number of ways to assign each person a unique month. So, for the first person, 12 choices, the second person has 11 choices (since one month is already taken), the third person has 10 choices, and so on, down to 2 choices for the fifth person.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. That's the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time, which is denoted as P(12,5).

Therefore, the probability that all five people are born in different months is P(12,5) / 12^5.

Then, the probability that at least two were born in the same month is 1 minus that probability.

Let me write this out step by step.

Total number of possible outcomes: 12^5.

Number of favorable outcomes for all different months: P(12,5) = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

So, probability all different: P = (12*11*10*9*8) / (12^5).

Simplify this:

P = (12*11*10*9*8) / (12*12*12*12*12)

We can cancel out one 12 from the numerator and denominator:

P = (11*10*9*8) / (12^4)

But 12^4 is 12*12*12*12, which is 20736.

Wait, let me compute 11*10*9*8 first: 11*10 is 110, 110*9 is 990, 990*8 is 7920.

So, P = 7920 / 20736.

Now, let me simplify that fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 7920 /48 = 165, 20736 /48= 432.

So, 165 / 432. Let me check if they can be divided further. 165 is 5*33=5*3*11. 432 is 16*27=16*3^3. So, both have a common factor of 3.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 165/3=55, 432/3=144.

So, now it's 55 / 144. Let me see if this can be simplified further. 55 is 5*11, 144 is 12^2=2^4*3^2. No common factors, so 55/144 is the simplified form.

So, the probability that all five are born in different months is 55/144.

Therefore, the probability that at least two were born in the same month is 1 - 55/144.

Compute that: 144/144 - 55/144 = 89/144.

So, the probability is 89/144.
