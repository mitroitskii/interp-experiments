<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think. I need to calculate probabilities, so maybe I should start by understanding the total number of possibilities and then figure out the favorable ones.

First, let's clarify the problem. We have 5 people, and we need to find the probability that at least two of them share the same birth month. Birth months range from 1 to 12, so each person has 12 possible months. Since it's a probability question, I think I need to consider all possible ways the 5 people could be born, and then find how many of those ways have at least two people sharing a month.

I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complement event and then subtract it from 1. The complement of "at least two people share the same month" is "all people have different birth months." So maybe if I can find the probability that all 5 people have distinct months, and then subtract that from 1, I'll get the desired probability. Yeah, that seems like a common strategy for "at least" problems. Let me try that approach.

So, total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people. Each person has 12 options, right? Since birth months are 1 to 12. So, for the first person, there are 12 possibilities. For the second person, since they could have the same or a different month, but in total, the number of possible ordered pairs is 12 * 12. Wait, actually, for unordered groups, it's combinations, but since each person is distinct, maybe order matters here? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since each person is independent of the others, the total number of possible month combinations is 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, so 12^5. That's because each person has 12 choices, and they are independent events. So, the total number of possible ways is 12^5. Let me note that: total possibilities = 12^5.

Now, for the number of favorable outcomes where all 5 people have distinct months. So, the first person has 12 choices. The second person must have a different month, so 11 choices. The third person must have a different month than the first two, so 10 choices. Fourth person: 9 choices. Fifth person: 8 choices. So, it's 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. Alternatively, this is the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time, which can also be written as P(12,5). Let me confirm that. Yes, permutations, because order matters here since each person is a different individual.

Therefore, the number of ways where all months are different is 12P5, which is 12*11*10*9*8. Let me compute that value. 12*11 is 132, 132*10 is 1320, 1320*9 is 11880, 11880*8 is 95040. So, 95,040 ways.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for all distinct months is 95,040. Then, the number of possible outcomes is 12^5, which is 12*12*12*12*12. Let me calculate that. 12^2 is 144, 144^2 is 20736, 20736*12 is 248832, 248832*12 is 2985984. So, 2,985,984.

Therefore, the probability that all people have distinct months is 95,040 / 2,985,984. Let me simplify that fraction. Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 95,040 ÷ 48 = 1975. 2,985,984 ÷ 48 = 62,000 something? Wait, 2,985,984 ÷ 48: 48*60,000 = 2,880,000. 2,985,984 - 2,880,000 = 105,984. 48*2000 = 96,000, so 105,984 - 96,000 = 9,984. 48*200 = 9,600, so 9,984 - 9,600 = 384. 48*8=384. So, 60,000 + 2,000 + 200 + 8 = 62,208. So, the simplified fraction is 1975 / 62,208.

Wait, but maybe I can divide numerator and denominator by something else. 1975 and 62,

<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to "at least" situations. I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. So, in this case, the complementary event of "at least 2 born in the same month" would be "all 5 people born in different months." If I can find the probability that all 5 are born in different months, I can subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.

But wait, how many months are there? I think it's 12 months in a year. So, each person has 12 possible birth months. That might be relevant for the calculations.

Let me structure this:

1. Total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people: Each person can be born in any of the 12 months, so it's 12^5.
2. Number of favorable outcomes where all 5 are born in different months: This would be the number of ways to assign each person a unique month. Since there are 12 months, the first person has 12 choices, the second has 11, the third has 10, and so on until the fifth person has 8 choices. So, this is a permutation problem: 12P5.
3. Therefore, the probability that all 5 are born in different months is (12P5) / (12^5).
4. The probability that at least 2 are born in the same month is then 1 minus that probability.

Let me compute each step.

First, total number of possible outcomes: 12^5. Let me calculate that. 12^5 is 12*12*12*12*12. Let me compute step by step:

12^2 = 144
12^3 = 144*12 = 1728
12^4 = 1728*12 = 20736
12^5 = 20736*12 = 248832

So, 12^5 is 248,832.

Next, number of favorable outcomes where all 5 are born in different months. As I thought earlier, this is a permutation of 12 months taken 5 at a time. The formula for permutations is n! / (n - k)! where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So here, n=12, k=5.

12P5 = 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7!

Calculating 12! / 7!:

12! = 12×11×10×9×8×7! So, 12! / 7! = 12×11×10×9×8

Let me compute that:

12×11 = 132

132×10 = 1320

1320×9 = 11,880

11,880×8 = 95,040

So, 12P5 is 95,040.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 are born in different months is 95,040 / 248,832.

Let me simplify that fraction.

First, let's see if both numbers are divisible by 48. 95,040 ÷ 48: 95,040 ÷ 48 = 1,980. 248,832 ÷ 48 = 5,184.

So, the fraction becomes 1,980 / 5,184.

Wait, let me check if that can be simplified further. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 12: 1,980 ÷ 12 = 165, 5,184 ÷ 12 = 432. So, 165/432.

Hmm, 165 and 432, let's see if they have a common divisor. 165 is 5×33, which is 5×3×11. 432 is 16×27, which is 2^4 × 3^3. So, the common factor is 3. Dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 165 ÷ 3 = 55, 432 ÷ 3 = 144. So, 55/144.

Is 55 and 144 coprime? 55 is 5×11, and 144 is 12^2, which is 2^4×3^2. No common factors, so 55/144 is the simplified fraction.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 people are born in different months is 55/144.

So, the probability that at least
