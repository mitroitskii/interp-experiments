<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let's see. I think I can approach this by using probability concepts. Maybe combinatorics?

First, I should figure out the total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people. Since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, the total number of possible combinations would be 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, right? So that's \(12^5\). Let me calculate that. 12 squared is 144, 144 cubed is 12*12*12 = 1728, 1728*12 is 20736, and then 20736*12 is 248832. So, total possible combinations are 248,832.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability that at least 2 people were born in the same month. Hmm. Calculating the probability for at least 2 directly might be complicated. Maybe it's easier to calculate the probability that no two people were born in the same month and then subtract that from 1.

That makes sense because "at least 2" is the complement of "no two people share the same birth month." So, let me define the events. Let A be the event that at least two people were born in the same month, and B be the event that all five people were born in different months. So, we want P(A) = 1 - P(B).

Okay, so first, let's find P(B). To calculate the probability that all five people have distinct birth months, we can use permutations or combinations? Hmm, since the order matters here, maybe permutations. So, for the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, to have a different month than the first, there are 11 months left. The third person must have a different month from both previous, so 10, and so on until the fifth person.

So, the number of ways this can happen is \(12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8\). Let me compute that. 12*11 is 132, 132*10 is 1320, 1320*9 is 11880, 11880*8 is 95040.

Therefore, P(B) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes, which is 95040 / 248832.

Let me compute that fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 95040. So 95040 ÷ 95040 is 1, and 248832 ÷ 95040. Let me do that division.

Well, 95040 x 2 is 190080. 248832 - 190080 is 58752. So, 2 + (58752 / 95040). What's 58752 divided by 95040? Let me see, both are divisible by 48: 58752 ÷ 48 is 1224, and 95040 ÷ 48 is 1980. So, 1224 / 1980.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1224 ÷12=102, 1980 ÷12=165. So, 102/165. They can be divided by 3: 102 ÷3=34, 165 ÷3=55. So, 34/55.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 + (34/55). Wait, no, that can't be right because I think I messed up the initial division step. Let me backtrack.

When I had 248832 divided by 95040, perhaps I should simplify the fraction step by step.

95040 is the numerator? Wait no, P(B) is 95040 / 248832.

So, 95040 / 248832. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 95040 first.

So, 95040 / 95040 = 1.

248832 / 95040. Let's compute how many times 95040 fits into 248832.

95040 x 2 = 190080

248832 - 190080 = 58752

So, it's 2 + 58752 / 95040.

Now, 58752 / 95040. Let's simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 58752 ÷48 = 1224, 95040 ÷48=1980.

So, 1224 /1980.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1224 ÷12=102, 1980 ÷12=165.

So, 102/165.

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let's see. I think I need to figure out the probability that at least two people share the same birth month. 

First, I remember that probability can often be approached by calculating the probability of the complementary event and then subtracting it from 1. The complementary event here would be that all 5 people have different birth months. So, if I can find the probability that all 5 have different months, then I can subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least two share the same month.

Alright, so let me break this down. There are 12 months in a year, right? So, each person's birthday can be thought of as an independent event with 12 possible outcomes. Since we're dealing with birthdays, each month is equally likely, I assume.

Now, for the first person, the probability of being born in any specific month is 1/12. But since we don't care about the specific month, just that they are born in one, the probability that the first person is born in any month is 1. It's just the starting point.

The second person's birthday is also independent of the first, so the probability that the second person is born in a different month than the first is... hmm, let's see. There are 11 remaining months, so 11/12. So, the probability that the second person is not born in the same month as the first is 11/12.

Similarly, for the third person, the probability that they are not born in the same month as the first two is 10/12, because two months are already taken. Wait, is that right? Let me think. Each time we add a person, we have one fewer month available, so yes, 12 - (number of people already considered) months left.

So, for the third person, it's 10/12, fourth person is 9/12, and the fifth person is 8/12. So, the probability that all five have different birth months is the product of these probabilities. That is:

1 * (11/12) * (10/12) * (9/12) * (8/12)

Let me compute that. 

First, 11/12 is approximately 0.9167, but I'll keep it as fractions for accuracy. So, 11/12 * 10/12 is (11*10)/(12*12) = 110/144. Then, multiplying by 9/12 gives (110*9)/(144*12). Wait, maybe I should do it step by step:

1. Multiply 11/12 * 10/12: numerator is 11*10=110, denominator is 12*12=144. So, 110/144.

2. Multiply that by 9/12: numerator is 110*9=990, denominator is 144*12=1728. So, 990/1728.

3. Then multiply by 8/12: numerator is 990*8=7920, denominator is 1728*12=20736. So, 7920/20736.

Hmm, let me see if this simplifies. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 24: 7920 ÷24=330, 20736 ÷24=864. So, 330/864. Hmm, can we divide by 6? 330 ÷6=55, 864 ÷6=144. So, 55/144.

So, the probability that all five have different birth months is 55/144. Therefore, the probability that at least two share the same month is 1 - 55/144.

Let me compute 1 - 55/144. 144/144 - 55/144 = 89/144.

So, the probability is 89/144. Let me check that again. Is that correct?

Wait, another way to think about it is using permutations. The total number of possible birthday combinations for 5 people is 12^5, since each person has 12 possibilities. The number of favorable outcomes where all birthdays are different is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8, which is the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time.

So, the probability is (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / 12^5.

Let's compute that. 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 is 95040. 12^5 is 248832. So, 95040 / 248832.
