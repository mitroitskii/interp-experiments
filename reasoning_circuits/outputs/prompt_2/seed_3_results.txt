<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that when dealing with probability problems like this, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event in this case would be that no two people were born in the same month, right? So, if I can find the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months, then subtracting that from 1 should give me the probability that at least two share a birth month.

First, I need to figure out how many months there are. There are 12 months in a year, so each person can be born in any of the 12 months. Now, if I have 5 people, the total number of possible birth month combinations is 12^5, because each person independently can choose any month. But wait, hold on, is it 12^5 or something else? Hmm, actually, for the total number of possible outcomes, yes, it is 12^5 because each of the 5 people can be assigned any month without restriction. So that gives me 12^5 possible combinations.

Now, for the favorable outcomes where all 5 people have different birth months, that's going to be 12P5, which stands for permutations. 12P5 is calculated as 12! / (12-5)! So, let me compute that. 12! is 12 factorial, which is 12×11×10×9×8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1, but since we're dividing by (12-5)!, which is 7!, we can simplify it. So, 12P5 = 12×11×10×9×8. Let me calculate that: 12×11 is 132, 132×10 is 1320, 1320×9 is 11880, and 11880×8 is 95040. So, 12P5 is 95,040. That means there are 95,040 ways to assign 5 different months to each person.

Wait, hold on, so the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5. Let me compute that as well. 12^5 is 12×12×12×12×12. Calculating step by step: 12×12 is 144, 144×12 is 1728, 1728×12 is 20736, and 20736×12 is 248,832. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 248,832. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 95,040 and the total possible outcomes is 248,832.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months is 95,040 / 248,832. Let me compute that. I can simplify the fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 48, I think. Let me check: 95,040 divided by 48 is, let me see, 95,040 ÷ 48. 48×2000 is 96,000, which is a bit more than 95,040. So, 48×1975 is, well, maybe it's better to divide numerator and denominator by 48. 95,040 ÷ 48 is equal to (95,040 ÷ 12) ÷ 4. 95,040 ÷ 12 is 7,920. Then 7,920 ÷ 4 is 1,980. Similarly, 248,832 ÷ 48 is (248,832 ÷ 12) ÷ 4. 248,832 ÷ 12 is 20,736, then ÷4 is 5,184. So, now the fraction is 1,980 / 5,184.

I can simplify this further. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1,980 ÷12 is 165, and 5,184 ÷12 is 432. So, the fraction is 165 / 432. Hmm, can this be simplified more? Let's see. 165 and 432 are both divisible by 3: 165 ÷3 is 55, and 432 ÷3 is 144. So, now we have 55 / 144. Hmm, that can't be simplified further because 55 is 5×11 and 144 is 12 squared, which is 2^4×3^2, so no common factors. So, the probability that all 5 people were born in different months is 55/144.

But remember, the question asks for the

Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that probability questions like this often involve combinations and maybe the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle says that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this case, the "pigeons" are the people, and the "pigeonholes" are the months. Since there are 12 months, we have 12 pigeonholes. But we have 5 people, which is less than 12, so the principle doesn't apply directly here. Instead, I need to calculate the probability that at least two people share the same birth month.

Calculating probabilities for "at least" often involves finding the complement probability. The complement of "at least 2 were born in the same month" is "all were born in different months." So, if I can find the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months, then subtract that from 1, I'll get the desired probability.

Alright, so let's break it down. First, what's the probability that all 5 people are born in different months? Well, for the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, since we want a different month, there are 11 remaining months. For the third person, 10 months, and so on. So, the number of ways all 5 can have different birth months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. 

But wait, since the order of selection doesn't matter in probability, we should consider this as a combination. So, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 5 different months out of 12. That would be the combination of 12 choose 5, which is calculated as 12! / (5! * (12-5)!).

And the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways all 5 people can be born in any months, regardless of duplication. That would be 12^5 since each person independently has 12 possible months.

So, the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months is (12 choose 5) / 12^5. Therefore, the probability that at least two people share the same birth month is 1 minus that.

Let me write this down step by step:

1. Number of ways all 5 can have different birth months: C(12,5) = 792.
2. Total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people: 12^5 = 248832.
3. Probability all have different months: 792 / 248832.
4. Simplify that: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 792. 792 ÷ 792 = 1, and 248832 ÷ 792 = 316. So, 1/316? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my math.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying. Let me calculate 792 / 248832. First, let's see how many times 792 goes into 248832.

Divide 248832 by 792:

792 × 300 = 237,600

248,832 - 237,600 = 11,232

792 × 14 = 11,088

11,232 - 11,088 = 144

792 × 0.18 ≈ 142.56

So, total is approximately 300 + 14 + 0.18 ≈ 314.18. Hmm, so it's roughly 314.18 times. Wait, so 792 × 314.18 ≈ 248,832. That would mean 792 / 248,832 ≈ 1 / 314.18, so approximately 0.00318.

Wait, that seems really low. Is that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, 12 choose 5 is 792, and 12^5 is 248,832. So, 792 divided by 248,832 is indeed 1 / 314.16, which is about 0.00318 or 0.318%. That seems low, but considering that with 5 people, the chance that all have different months is quite low.

But let me cross-verify this with another approach. Alternatively, I can calculate the probability step by step, considering each person's birth month.

For the first person, the probability doesn't matter since they can be born in any month. For the second person, the probability that they are not born in the same month as the first is 11/12. For the third person, the probability they are not
