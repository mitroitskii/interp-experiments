<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving combinations where we don't care about the order, we can often use the concept of combinations. Since we're dealing with people and months, I should probably consider the number of ways people can be born in different months and then use that to calculate the probability.

Let me start by recalling the formula for probability. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the number of ways that at least two people can be born in the same month. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of ways the 5 people could be born in the 12 months.

But wait, "at least two" can sometimes be tricky because it includes scenarios like two, three, four, or five people being born in the same month. Calculating each of these might be complicated. Is there another way to approach this?

Oh, right! There's a principle called the complementary probability. Instead of calculating the probability of at least two people being born in the same month directly, I can calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is that no two people are born in the same month, and then subtract that from 1.

Yes, that makes sense. It's often easier to compute the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1 to find the desired probability.

So, first, I need to compute the total number of possible outcomes. Since there are 5 people and each can be born in any of the 12 months, the total number of possible birthday combinations is 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 12^5. Let me write that down: Total outcomes = 12^5.

Now, for the complementary event, where no two people are born in the same month, I need to compute the number of ways each person can have a unique month. Since there are 12 months and 5 people, this is essentially a permutation problem where each person must choose a distinct month.

Wait, actually, since the order of birth months doesn't matter, this is a combination problem. For the first person, there are 12 choices. For the second person, since they can't be born in the same month as the first, there are 11 choices. For the third person, 10 choices, and so on. But no, wait, actually, for permutations, if the order matters, we have 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. But since the order doesn't matter, perhaps it's just combinations.

Hold on, maybe I should think of it as assigning each person a unique month. Since each person must have a different month, it's like selecting 5 different months out of 12 and then assigning each person to a month.

So, the number of ways to choose 5 different months is the combination of 12 months taken 5 at a time, which is 12 choose 5, or written as C(12,5). Then, once we have chosen the 5 months, we have to assign each person to a specific month. Since the order matters here (each person is assigned a specific month), we need to multiply by the number of permutations of the 5 months.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for the complementary event is C(12,5) multiplied by 5! because we are choosing which months to assign and then permuting them.

Alternatively, another way to think of it is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8, which is also equal to 12P5, the permutation of 12 months taken 5 at a time.

Let me check which one is correct. If I think of the first person having 12 choices, the second person having 11, the third 10, the fourth 9, and the fifth 8, that gives 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 = 95040. On the other hand, C(12,5) is 792, and 5! is 120, so 792 * 120 = 95040. Okay, both methods give the same number, so that checks out.

So, total favorable outcomes for the complementary event (no two people born in the same month) is 95040.

Therefore, the probability of the complementary event is 95040 / 12^5.

Calculating 12^5: 12 * 12 = 144; 144 * 12 = 1728; 1728 * 12 = 20736; 20736 * 12 = 248832

Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving combinations where order doesn't matter, it's often useful to use combinations and the concept of favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out the total number of ways 5 people can be born in different months and then subtract that from the total number of possible birth month combinations to find the number of favorable outcomes (where at least two share a month). Then, divide that by the total number of possible outcomes to get the probability.

Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I have the right approach. Sometimes, it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be that no two people share the same birth month, right? So, if I calculate the probability that all five people were born in different months, then subtract that probability from 1, I'll get the probability that at least two share a month. That might be a simpler way.

So, let's structure it step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people.**
   - Each person can be born in any of the 12 months. Since the order doesn't matter, it's a matter of combinations with repetition allowed. The formula for combinations with repetition is C(n + k - 1, k), where n is the number of types (months, so 12) and k is the number of selections (people, so 5).
   - So, the total number of possible outcomes is C(12 + 5 - 1, 5) = C(16, 5).
   - Calculating C(16,5): 16! / (5! * (16-5)!) = (16*15*14*13*12)/(5*4*3*2*1) = 4368.
   - So, total possible outcomes = 4368.

2. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes where all 5 people were born in different months.**
   - Since each person must have a unique birth month, it's essentially assigning each person a different month.
   - So, the first person has 12 choices, the second person has 11 choices, the third has 10, the fourth has 9, and the fifth has 8.
   - However, since the order of selection doesn't matter in combinations, we need to adjust for overcounting. So, it's 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 / 5! to account for the permutations of the same set.
   - Alternatively, since we're dealing with combinations without repetition, the number of ways is C(12,5).
   - Calculating C(12,5): 12! / (5! * (12-5)!) = (12*11*10*9*8)/(5*4*3*2*1) = 792.
   - So, the number of favorable outcomes for all different months is 792.

3. **Calculate the probability that all 5 people were born in different months.**
   - Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 792 / 4368.
   - Let me compute that: 792 ÷ 4368. Hmm, both numbers are divisible by 24? Let's see: 792 ÷ 24 = 33, 4368 ÷ 24 = 182. So, 33/182. Can this be simplified further? 33 and 182 share a common factor of 11: 33 ÷ 11 = 3, 182 ÷ 11 = 16.6... Wait, no, 11*16=176, so 182-176=6. So, 182 isn't divisible by 11. Wait, maybe 13? 13*14=182. So, 33 and 182 have a common factor of 1. So, the simplified probability is 33/182.

4. **Calculate the probability that at least two people were born in the same month.**
   - As I thought earlier, it's 1 minus the probability that all were born in different months.
   - So, Probability = 1 - (33/182) = (182/182 - 33/182) = 149/182.

Wait, hold on, let me verify these calculations because I feel like I might have messed up somewhere.
