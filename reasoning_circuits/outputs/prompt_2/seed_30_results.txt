<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that often when we need the probability of at least one event happening, it's easier to calculate the complement probability instead. The complement of "at least 2 born in the same month" is "all 5 born in different months," right? So maybe I can find the probability that all 5 people are born in different months and then subtract that from 1.

Yeah, that makes sense because calculating the probability of all being different might be simpler. Let me confirm: So, the probability we’re looking for is P(at least 2 in same month) = 1 - P(all in different months). Perfect.

Now, let's figure out what each probability is. To find these probabilities, I probably need to know the number of people and the number of months. Well, there are 12 months in a year. So, the question reduces to: Given 5 people, what's the probability that all have distinct birth months? Then subtract that from 1.

Wait, but do we assume uniform probability for each month? That is, is each month equally likely? I think in most probability problems unless stated otherwise, we do assume that. So, for each person, the probability of being born in any specific month is 1/12. Also, their birth months are independent? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify any dependencies, so I think independence is a fair assumption.

So, for the first person, the probability doesn't matter because the other people's birthdays are what affects the calculation. Wait, no, actually, all five people have independent birth months. So, it's like arranging 5 items with 12 possibilities each.

Let me think step by step. The first person can be born in any month, so that's 12 possibilities. The second person has to be born in a different month than the first, so that's 11 possibilities. Similarly, the third person has to be born in a different month than the first two, so 10 possibilities, and so on.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for all five people being born in different months is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. The total number of possible outcomes for five people's birthdays is 12^5.

So, the probability that all five are born in different months is (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (12^5). Let me calculate that.

First, let me write down the numbers: 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, and then 12 to the power of 5, which is 12*12*12*12*12. Hmm.

Simplifying the numerator: 12*11*10*9*8. Let me compute that step by step:

12 * 11 = 132
132 * 10 = 1320
1320 * 9 = 11880
11880 * 8 = 95040

So, numerator is 95040.

Denominator: 12^5 = 12*12*12*12*12. Let's calculate 12^2 first: 12*12=144. Then, 144*12=1728, then 1728*12=20736, then 20736*12=248832. So, 12^5 is 248832.

So, probability all five are in different months is 95040 / 248832.

Let me compute that. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 95040:

95040 divided by 95040 is 1, and 248832 divided by 95040 is approximately 2.622... Wait, but let me see. Maybe it's easier to simplify the fraction.

Let me see if both numbers are divisible by 12. 95040 / 12 = 7920. 248832 / 12 = 20736. So now, the fraction is 7920 / 20736.

Divide numerator and denominator by 24: 7920 /24=330, 20736 /24=864. So, now 330 / 864.

Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 330 /6=55, 864 /6=144. So, 55 /144.

55 and 144 share no common divisors besides 1, so 55/144 is the simplified form.

So, the probability that all five are born in different months is 55/144.

Therefore, the probability that at least two are born in the same month is 1 - 55

Alright, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that when dealing with "at least" scenarios, it might be easier to calculate the complement probability. The complement of "at least 2 born in the same month" is "all 5 people born in different months." So, if I can find the probability that all 5 are born in different months, then subtract that from 1, I should get the desired probability.

But wait, how many months are there? There are 12 months in a year, right? So, each person can be born in any of the 12 months. Now, if we're dealing with independent events, the probability that each person is born in a different month can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each subsequent person.

Let me write this out step by step.

1. **Total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people:** Since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, and each month is independent, the total number of possible combinations is \(12^5\).

2. **Number of favorable outcomes where all 5 are born in different months:** This is a permutation problem because the order matters here. The first person can be born in any of the 12 months. The second person must be born in a different month, so that's 11 choices. The third person has 10 choices, the fourth has 9, and the fifth has 8. So, the number of favorable outcomes is \(12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8\).

3. **Calculating the probability:** The probability that all 5 people are born in different months is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that would be:

\[
\frac{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{12^5}
\]

Simplifying this, the numerator is \(12! / (12 - 5)! = 12P5\), and the denominator is \(12^5\). Let me compute this value.

First, calculate the numerator: \(12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8\).

12 x 11 is 132.

132 x 10 is 1320.

1320 x 9 is 11880.

11880 x 8 is 95040.

So, the numerator is 95040.

Now, the denominator is \(12^5\). Let's compute that.

12^2 is 144.

12^3 is 144 x 12 = 1728.

12^4 is 1728 x 12 = 20736.

12^5 is 20736 x 12 = 248832.

So, the probability that all 5 are born in different months is 95040 / 248832.

Let me simplify that fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 95040: 95040 ÷ 95040 = 1; 248832 ÷ 95040 = approximately 2.62. Wait, that's not exact. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, let's see if both numbers can be divided by 48.

95040 ÷ 48 = 1980.

248832 ÷ 48 = 5184.

So, 1980 / 5184.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1980 ÷ 12 = 165; 5184 ÷ 12 = 432.

So, 165 / 432.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 165 ÷ 3 = 55; 432 ÷ 3 = 144.

So, 55 / 144.

Hmm, okay, so 55/144 is approximately 0.3819, or 38.19%.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 are born in different months is approximately 38.19%. So, the probability that at least 2 are born in the same month is 1 - 0.3819 = 0.6181, or 61.81%.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because 55/144 seems a bit high for the "all different" probability, but maybe it's correct.

Alternatively, let me compute the probability step by step:

The probability that the first person is born in any month is 1.

The probability that the second person is born in a different month than the first is 11/12.

The third person has to be different from the first two: 10/12.

Fourth: 9
