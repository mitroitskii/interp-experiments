<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that probability questions can sometimes be tricky, especially when they ask for "at least" something. I think I should approach this by considering the opposite event, which is the probability that no two people were born in the same month. Then, I can subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability. Yeah, that seems like a good plan.

First, let me think about the months. There are 12 months in a year, right? So, each person has a birthday in one of these 12 months. That means when we're dealing with birthdays, we can model this with the concept of probability where each month has an equal chance of being a birthday. Since there are 12 months, the probability of being born in any specific month is 1/12. But since the problem is about 5 people, I need to think about the possible distributions of their birthdays across these 12 months.

Now, for the opposite event: all 5 people have unique birthdays, meaning no two share the same month. So, I need to find the number of ways this can happen and then divide it by the total number of possible birthday combinations for 5 people. The total number of possible birthday combinations is 12^5 because each person has 12 choices independently. So, 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12, which is 12^5. I can compute that as 248,832. Wait, let me check that math... 12*12 is 144, times 12 is 1728, times 12 is 20,736, times 12 is 248,832. Yes, that's correct.

Now, for the number of favorable outcomes where all five birthdays are unique. Hmm, how do I calculate that? Well, for the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, since they can't share a month with the first, there are 11 months left. Then the third person has 10 choices, the fourth has 9, and the fifth has 8. So, multiplying these together: 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. Let me compute that. 12*11 is 132, times 10 is 1320, times 9 is 11,880, times 8 is 95,040. So, there are 95,040 ways for all five birthdays to be unique.

Wait, hold on a second, that number seems low. Let me think again. Since the order in which we assign the months matters here, right? Because each person is distinct, so the number of injective functions from the set of people to the set of months is 12P5, which is 12! / (12 - 5)! = 95,040. Yes, that makes sense. So that's the number of unique birthday combinations where no two share the same month.

Therefore, the probability that no two people share a birthday month is the number of unique combinations divided by the total number of combinations. So, 95,040 / 248,832. Let me compute that fraction. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 48. 95,040 divided by 48 is 1,980. 248,832 divided by 48 is 5,184. So, the fraction simplifies to 1,980 / 5,184. Hmm, can I divide this further? Let's see if both numbers are divisible by 12. 1,980 / 12 is 165, and 5,184 / 12 is 432. So now we have 165 / 432. Are these divisible by 3? 165 ÷ 3 is 55, and 432 ÷ 3 is 144. So, now it's 55 / 144. 55 and 144 don't have any common factors besides 1, so that's as far as we can go.

Therefore, the probability that all five people have unique birth months is 55/144. So, the probability that at least two people share a birth month is 1 minus this probability. That would be 1 - 55/144. Calculating that gives 144/144 - 55/144 = 89/144. So, the probability is 89/144.

Wait a second, let me verify this once again because sometimes it's easy to make mistakes with permutations and combinations. The total number of possible birthday combinations is indeed 12^5, which is 248,832. For the number of unique birthday combinations, it's

<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but they often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out how many ways the 5 people can be born in such a way that at least two share the same birth month, and then divide that by the total number of ways they can be born regardless of the months.

Wait, but "at least two" can sometimes be a bit vague, right? It could mean two or more, so in this case, it's two or more people sharing the same birth month. But calculating that directly might be complicated because there are multiple cases: two people share the same month, three share, four share, or all five share. That sounds like a lot of cases to consider. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

I remember something about the complementary probability. Instead of calculating the probability of at least two sharing a month, maybe it's easier to calculate the probability that no two people share the same month, and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the desired probability. Yeah, that makes sense because sometimes it's simpler to calculate the complement.

Alright, so let's try that approach. First, I need to figure out the probability that all five people have different birth months. If I can find that, then subtracting it from 1 will give me the probability that at least two share a month.

But wait, how many months are there? There are 12 months in a year, right? So, if we have 5 people, and each can be born in any of the 12 months, but we want all of them to have unique birth months. Hmm, so the problem is similar to assigning each person a unique month out of 12.

This sounds like a permutation problem. For the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, since they can't share the same month as the first, there are 11 remaining months. For the third person, there are 10 months left, and so on. So, the number of ways to assign unique months to 5 people is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. That's the number of favorable outcomes for all unique months.

On the other hand, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to assign any months to the 5 people, regardless of duplication. Since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, independently, the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5. That's because each of the 5 people has 12 choices, and they're independent.

So, the probability that all five people have unique birth months is the number of favorable outcomes (permutations) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (all possible assignments). So that would be (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (12^5). Then, the probability that at least two share the same month is 1 minus that.

Let me write that down:

Probability(at least 2 same month) = 1 - (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (12^5)

Hmm, okay, let's compute that. First, let's compute the numerator: 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

12 * 11 is 132, 132 * 10 is 1320, 1320 * 9 is 11880, 11880 * 8 is 95040. So, the numerator is 95040.

The denominator is 12^5. Let's compute that. 12^2 is 144, 12^3 is 1728, 12^4 is 20736, 12^5 is 248832. So, the denominator is 248832.

So, the probability that all five have unique months is 95040 / 248832.

Let me compute that fraction. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 95040. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 95040.

95040 / 95040 is 1.

248832 / 95040: Let's compute that. 248832 ÷ 95040.

Well, 95040 * 2 is 190080. Subtract that from 248832: 248832 - 190080 = 58752.

95040 * 0.6 is 57024. 58752 - 57024 = 1728.

1728 is 95040 * 0.018.

Wait, this is getting messy.
