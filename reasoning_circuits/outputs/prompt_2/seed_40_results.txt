<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, that sounds interesting. I remember learning about probability and combinatorics, so maybe I can apply that here.

First, let me try to understand the question. We have 5 people, and we need to find the probability that at least two of them were born in the same month. The months are 12 in total, right? So, January to December, each with a different birth month.

I think the key here is to use the concept of combinations because the order in which people are born doesn't matter. It's all about the group of people and their birth months. So, we might need to figure out how many possible ways the 5 people can be born in different months and then compare that to the total number of possible birth month combinations.

Wait, actually, since each person can be born in any month, each person has 12 possible birth months. So, for 5 people, the total number of possible birth month combinations is 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 12^5. That makes sense because for each person, there are 12 choices, and their choices are independent.

But we need the number of favorable outcomes where at least two people share the same birth month. Hmm, "at least two" usually means we have to calculate the probability of two or more, which sometimes can be tricky. I recall that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtracting from 1.

What's the complementary event here? That would be the event that no two people were born in the same month, meaning all five people have unique birth months. That seems simpler to calculate. So, if I can find the probability that all five have different birth months, then subtract that from 1, I should get the probability that at least two share a birth month.

Alright, let's compute that. First, total number of possible combinations is 12^5. Let me verify that: for each person, 12 choices, 5 people, so yes, 12^5. Now, the number of ways all five can have different birth months. That would be the number of ways to assign each person a unique month.

So, the first person can be born in any month, 12 choices. The second person has to be born in a different month, so 11 choices. The third person has 10 choices, the fourth has 9, and the fifth has 8. So, that would be 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Alternatively, that can be written as 12 permute 5, which is 12! / (12-5)! = 12! / 7!.

Let me compute that value. 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Calculating step by step:

12 × 11 = 132
132 × 10 = 1320
1320 × 9 = 11880
11880 × 8 = 95040

So, there are 95,040 favorable ways where all five have different birth months.

Therefore, the probability that all five have different birth months is 95,040 divided by the total number of possible combinations, which is 12^5. Let me compute 12^5:

12^1 = 12

12^2 = 144

12^3 = 1728

12^4 = 20736

12^5 = 248832

So, 12^5 is 248,832.

Thus, the probability that all five have different birth months is 95,040 / 248,832.

Let me simplify that fraction. Dividing numerator and denominator by 48:

95,040 ÷ 48 = 1980

248,832 ÷ 48 = 5184

So, 1980 / 5184. Simplify further by dividing both by 12:

1980 ÷ 12 = 165

5184 ÷ 12 = 432

165 / 432. Hmm, can we divide by 3?

165 ÷ 3 = 55

432 ÷ 3 = 144

55 / 144. That doesn't simplify further, so 55/144 is approximately 0.3819.

So, the probability that all five have different birth months is approximately 38.19%. Therefore, the probability that at least two share a birth month is 1 minus that, which is approximately 61.81%.

Wait, but let me confirm that. If 55/144 is approximately 0.3819, then 1 - 0.3819 is approximately 0.6181,

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find how many ways at least 2 people can be born in the same month and then divide that by the total number of ways the 5 people can be born.

But wait, when it comes to probability, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be that no two people are born in the same month. So, if I can find the probability that all 5 people have different birth months, then subtracting that from 1 will give me the probability that at least two were born in the same month. That seems like a good approach.

Okay, so let's start by figuring out the total number of possible outcomes. Since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, and the birthdays are independent, the total number of possible birthday combinations for 5 people is 12^5. Let me compute that: 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12. Hmm, 12 squared is 144, cubed is 1728, to the fourth power is 20736, and fifth power is 248832. So, 248,832 total possible combinations.

Now, let's think about the number of ways all 5 people can have unique birth months. Since there are 12 months, the first person can be born in any month. The second person must be born in a different month, so 11 choices. The third person must have a different month from the first two, so 10 choices. The fourth person has 9 choices, and the fifth person has 8 choices. So, the number of ways all 5 can have different months is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

Let me calculate that: 12 * 11 is 132, times 10 is 1320, times 9 is 11880, times 8 is 95040. So, 95,040 ways where all have different months.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 have different birth months is the number of favorable outcomes (95,040) divided by total outcomes (248,832). Let me compute that: 95,040 / 248,832. Hmm, I can simplify this fraction. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 48. 95,040 ÷ 48 is 1975, and 248,832 ÷ 48 is 5184. So, 1975/5184. Let me see if this can be reduced further. 1975 is 5^2 * 79, and 5184 is 2^6 * 3^4. They don't have any common factors, so that's the simplified fraction.

To get the decimal probability, I can divide 1975 by 5184. Let me see: 1975 ÷ 5184 is approximately 0.381. So, about 38.1% chance that all 5 people have different birth months.

Therefore, the probability that at least two were born in the same month is 1 minus that probability, which is 1 - 0.381 = 0.619. So, approximately 61.9%.

Wait, hold on. Let me verify that calculation because 12*11*10*9*8 is 95040, right? And 12^5 is 248832. So, 95040 / 248832. Let me double-check the division.

95040 divided by 248832. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 95040: numerator becomes 1, denominator becomes 26.16. Hmm, that doesn't help. Alternatively, let's divide numerator and denominator by 48: 95040 ÷ 48 is 1975, 248832 ÷ 48 is 5184. So, 1975/5184. Let me compute this division more accurately.

5184 goes into 1975 zero times. Add a decimal point. 5184 goes into 19750 about 3 times (3*5184=15552). Subtract: 19750 - 15552 = 4198. Bring down a zero: 41980. 5184 goes into 41980 about 8 times (8*5184=41472). Subtract: 41980 - 41472 = 508. Bring down a zero: 5080. 5184 goes into 5080 zero times.
