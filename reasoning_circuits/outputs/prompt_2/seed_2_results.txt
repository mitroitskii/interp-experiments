<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially with "at least" in the question. I remember that calculating probability for "at least" often involves considering the complement event. Instead of calculating the probability that at least two people share a birthday month, I might find it easier to calculate the probability that no two people share a month, and then subtract that from 1.

That seems like a good strategy. So, let me note that:

P(at least 2 in same month) = 1 - P(all months are different)

Okay, so now I need to calculate P(all months are different). Let's break this down.

Assuming that each person can be born in any of the 12 months, right? So, the first person can be born in any month. The second person would need to be born in a different month than the first, the third person in a different month from both the first and the second, and so on.

This sounds like a permutation problem without replacement. Because once someone has chosen a month, the next person can't choose the same one. So, the number of ways this can happen is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

Wait, let me make sure. So for the first person, there are 12 months to choose from. For the second person, since they can't share a month with the first, they have 11 options. The third person has 10 options, avoiding both of the previous months, and so on until the fifth person, who would have 8 options.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the number of favorable outcomes for all months being different is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

Now, the total number of possible outcomes for 5 people regarding their birth months is 12^5, since each of the 5 people can be born in any of the 12 months.

So, the probability that all months are different is (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / 12^5.

Therefore, the probability that at least two people share a month is 1 minus that.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, the numerator for the favorable outcomes for all different months is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. Let me compute that:

12 * 11 = 132

132 * 10 = 1320

1320 * 9 = 11880

11880 * 8 = 95040

So, 95040 is the numerator.

The total number of possible outcomes is 12^5. Let's compute that:

12^1 = 12

12^2 = 144

12^3 = 1728

12^4 = 20736

12^5 = 248832

Okay, so 248,832 total possible outcomes.

So, the probability that all months are different is 95040 / 248832.

Now, I should simplify this fraction.

First, let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by 95040. Let me check:

248832 ÷ 95040 = approximately 2.62... Wait, but maybe we can simplify step by step.

Alternatively, divide numerator and denominator by 48.

95040 ÷ 48 = let's compute:

48 * 2000 = 96,000

95040 - 96,000 = -96, so 48 * 1980 = 95040 - 96,000 = 95040. Wait, that seems confused. Alternatively, just compute 95040 ÷ 48.

48 * 1900 = 91,200

95040 - 91,200 = 6,240

48 * 130 = 6,240

So, total is 1900 + 130 = 2030. So, 95040 ÷ 48 = 1980.

Similarly, 248,832 ÷ 48: Let's compute:

48 * 5000 = 240,000

248,832 - 240,000 = 8,832

48 * 180 = 8,640

8,832 - 8,640 = 192

48 * 4 = 192

So, 5000 + 180 + 4 = 5184.

So now, the fraction becomes 1980 / 5184.

We can simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 12:

1980 ÷ 12 = 165

5184 ÷ 12 = 432

So, 165 /

Alright, so I have this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to combinatorics. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving combinations, it's often helpful to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. Then, the probability is just the ratio of favorable to total outcomes.

So, in this case, we have 5 people. Let's assume that each person can be born in any month, right? There are 12 months in a year, so each person has 12 possible birth months. So, if I want to find the probability that at least 2 people share the same birth month, I need to figure out how many ways this can happen and then divide that by the total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people.

Wait, but hold on. The problem says "at least 2 were born in the same month." That means I have to consider cases where exactly 2 share the same month, exactly 3 share the same month, exactly 4 share the same month, and all 5 share the same month. Calculating all these cases individually might be complicated because there are multiple ways this can happen. Maybe there's a smarter way to do this without having to compute each case separately.

I remember something called the principle of inclusion-exclusion in probability. Maybe that can help here. Or perhaps it's related to the pigeonhole principle? The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. Translating that to our problem, we have 5 people (pigeons) and 12 months (pigeonholes). Since 5 is less than 12, the pigeonhole principle alone doesn't guarantee that at least two people share the same month. Hmm, so maybe that's not directly helpful here.

But wait, the pigeonhole principle does say that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, but in our case, 5 is less than 12, so it's possible that all 5 people have different birth months. So, the probability that at least two share the same month is 1 minus the probability that all five have different birth months. That seems like a better approach. Instead of calculating all the cases where two, three, four, or five share the same month, I can just subtract the probability of all months being unique from 1.

Alright, so let me formalize that. Let P(at least 2) = 1 - P(all 5 have different birth months). So, first, I need to compute P(all 5 have different birth months). Then, subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.

To compute P(all 5 have different birth months), I can use combinations. The first person can be born in any month, so there's 12 possibilities. The second person must be born in a different month than the first, so there are 11 possibilities. The third person must be born in a different month from the first two, so 10 possibilities, and so on. So, the number of favorable outcomes for all 5 people having different birth months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

But wait, since the order in which we assign the months doesn't matter, we need to consider that these are permutations. So, the number of ways to assign 5 different months out of 12 is given by the permutation formula: P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)! So, in this case, P(12, 5) = 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7! Which is equal to 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7! / 7! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. So, that's correct.

But actually, when dealing with probabilities, sometimes it's easier to think in terms of combinations. Wait, is that the same? Let me clarify. The number of ways to choose 5 different months out of 12 is C(12, 5), which is 12! / (5! * (12 - 5)!)) = 792. But in permutations, we are considering order, so 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 is 95040, which is 12 P 5.

But when dealing with probabilities, since each outcome is equally likely, we can think of the total number of possible birth month combinations as 12^5, since each of the 5 people
