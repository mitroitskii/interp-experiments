<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, sounds interesting. I think I can figure this out, but let me take it step by step.

First off, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to combinatorics. So, let me recall some basic concepts. Probability is essentially the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find how many ways at least 2 people can be born in the same month, and then divide that by all possible ways 5 people can be born in any months.

Wait, but is it that straightforward? Actually, sometimes "at least" can complicate things because it's easier to calculate the complement probability and then subtract from 1. So, in this case, maybe it's easier to calculate the probability that no two people are born in the same month, and then subtract that from 1. Hmm, sounds good. Let me try that approach.

So, let me define the events. Let me denote each person's birth month as a separate event. Since we're dealing with months, which are 12 in total, each person has 12 possible outcomes. But wait, hold on—wait, are the months equally likely? I think so, because the problem doesn't specify any biases towards certain months. So, each month has a probability of 1/12 for each person. Hmm, so it's similar to 5 independent trials where each trial has 12 possible outcomes, right?

So, if we think about the birthday problem, which is similar, but here instead of 365 days, it's 12 months. But okay, let's not get confused—let's stick with the 5 people and 12 months.

So, the total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people is 12^5, because each person independently can be born in any of the 12 months. Alternatively, 12 multiplied by itself 5 times. Let me just compute that: 12 * 12 is 144, 144 * 12 is 1728, 1728 *12 is 20736, and 20736*12 is 248832. So, 248,832 total possible combinations.

But okay, maybe I can keep it as 12^5 for now since I might need to do some intermediate computations in terms of exponents.

So, next, I need to find the number of ways in which all 5 people have unique birth months, meaning no two share the same month. Then, the probability that no two share the same month is that number divided by 12^5.

And once I have that, subtract it from 1, and I should have the probability that at least two people share the same month.

So, how do I compute the number of ways all 5 people can have unique birth months?

Well, for the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, to not share a month with the first, there are 11 possible months left. For the third person, 10 possible months, and so on, down to 8, because by the fifth person, there would be 12 - 5 +1 = 8 months left.

Wait, so it's like permutations. The number of ways to arrange 5 distinct months out of 12 is given by 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. Let me confirm that.

Yes, so if we have 12 months, and we need to choose 5 without repetition, the number of permutations is P(12,5) = 12! / (12-5)! = 12! / 7! = 12*11*10*9*8, which is 95040.

So, that gives us the number of favorable outcomes where all 5 have unique months. Therefore, the probability that all 5 are unique is 95040 / 248832.

Let me compute that. 95040 divided by 248832.

Hmm, maybe simplify the fraction first. Let's see. Both numbers are divisible by 48.

95040 ÷ 48 is 95040 / 48. Let's see, 48*2000 is 96,000. 95040-96000= -96, so wait, no. 48*2000=96000. But 95040 is less than that. So, 48*1980=95040? 48*1900=91200, 48*80=3840, so 91200+3840=95040. Yeah, so 1980.

Similarly, 248832 ÷ 48: 248832 ÷ 48.

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, interesting. I need to figure this out. Let me think about how to approach it.

First, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but often they can be broken down into smaller, more manageable parts. Since the question is about the probability that at least two people share the same birth month, I should probably consider the opposite scenario first. That is, the probability that no two people share the same birth month, and then subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.

So, let's denote the probability that at least two people were born in the same month as P. Then, the probability that no two people share the same birth month would be 1 - P. Therefore, P = 1 - (probability that all 5 people have unique birth months). That seems like a good plan.

Now, I need to figure out the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months. To do this, I should consider the number of possible ways the birth months can be arranged and then divide that by the total number of possible combinations.

First, let's recall that there are 12 months in a year. So, each person can be born in any of the 12 months. If we're looking for unique birth months, the first person can be born in any of the 12 months. The second person must be born in a different month, so that would be 11 choices. The third person must be born in a different month from the first two, so 10 choices. This pattern continues until the fifth person, who would have only 8 choices (since 12 - 4 = 8) to have a unique birth month.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes (where all five have unique birth months) is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me write that down:

Number of favorable outcomes = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8

Now, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways that 5 people can be born in 12 months without any restrictions. That would be the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time. The formula for permutations is n! / (n - k)! where n is the total number of things, and k is how many you're choosing. So in this case, it would be 12! / (12 - 5)! which is 12! / 7!.

Alternatively, since order matters here (each person is distinct), the total number of possible outcomes is indeed 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × ... but since we're only choosing 5, we can stop at 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Wait, no, that's the same as the number of favorable outcomes. Hmm, actually, no. Wait, the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5 because each person independently can be born in any of the 12 months. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Wait, hold on. So, is the total number of possible outcomes 12^5 or is it 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8? Because if we think about it, when order matters, the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5, since each of the 5 people can be assigned any of the 12 months. On the other hand, if order doesn't matter, then it's the number of combinations, which is C(12,5) multiplied by 5! (since once you choose the months, you can arrange them among the people). But wait, actually, I think the correct way is to consider that for each person, the choice is independent, so it's 12^5. However, when calculating the number of favorable outcomes where all are unique, it's 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8, which is 12P5. So, the probability is 12P5 / 12^5.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months is (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / (12^5). So, 1 minus that would be the probability that at least two share a birth month.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

12 × 11 is 132, 132 × 10 is 1320, 1320 × 9 is 11880, 11880 × 8 is 95040.

So, the numerator is 95040.
