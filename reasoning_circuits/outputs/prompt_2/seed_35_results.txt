<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, that sounds interesting. I think I can figure it out, but I need to take it step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. I have 5 people, and I want to find the probability that at least two of them were born in the same month. When it says "at least two," that usually means it's the complement of "all of them born in different months." So maybe I can use the complement rule here. Yeah, that makes sense because sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1.

So, the complement of "at least two born in the same month" is "all five born in different months." So if I can find the probability that all five are born in different months, then subtract that from 1, I'll get my desired probability. Let's note that down.

Total probability is 1, so probability(at least two same month) = 1 - probability(all different months). Got it.

Now, I need to figure out the number of possible ways the five people can be born in different months. Since each person has a birthday in one of 12 months, and there are 5 people, this is like arranging their birthdays month by month.

Wait, but hold on. When dealing with probabilities here, do I need to consider the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes?

So, let me model this correctly. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways 5 people can be assigned birthdays, regardless of the month. Since each person's birthday is independent and can be any of 12 months, the total number of possible birthday combinations is 12^5, right? Because for each person, there are 12 choices, and there are 5 people.

So, total possible outcomes = 12^5.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes for all five being born in different months is the number of ways to assign five different months out of 12. Since order matters here, it's similar to permutations.

So, how do we compute that? Well, the first person can be born in any of the 12 months, the second person in any of the remaining 11 months, the third person in 10, and so on.

That is, the number of favorable outcomes is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

Wait, let me check: For the first person, 12 choices, second person 11 to avoid same month as first, third person 10, etc., down to 8 for the fifth person. Yep, that makes sense.

So, the probability that all five are born in different months is (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (12^5).

Therefore, the probability that at least two share a birthday month is 1 - [(12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / 12^5].

Alright, so let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the numerator of the favorable outcomes for all different months: 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

Let me calculate that:

12 * 11 = 132.

132 * 10 = 1320.

1320 * 9 = 11880.

11880 * 8 = 95040.

So, numerator is 95040.

Now, denominator is 12^5. Let's compute 12^5:

12^1 = 12

12^2 = 144

12^3 = 1728

12^4 = 20736

12^5 = 248832

Okay, so denominator is 248832.

Therefore, probability(all different months) = 95040 / 248832.

Hmm, what's that as a decimal? Let me divide 95040 by 248832.

Alternatively, maybe I can simplify the fraction. Let's see:

Divide numerator and denominator by 95040:

95040 ÷ 95040 = 1.

248832 ÷ 95040. Let me see: 95040 * 2 = 190080, and 95040 * 2.6 is approx 248,832 because 95040 * 2 = 190080; 95040 * 0.6 = 57,024; so 190080 + 57,024 = 247,104. Hmm, that's close but not exact. Maybe exact division.

Wait, perhaps factor it differently.

Let's compute the fraction 95040 / 248832.

Divide numerator and denominator by 95040:

Numerator becomes 1, denominator becomes 248

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that often it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. So, in this case, instead of calculating the probability that at least 2 people share a birthday month, maybe I can calculate the probability that no two people share a birthday month and then subtract that from 1. That sounds like a plan.

Alright, so let's break it down. We're dealing with 5 people and their birth months. I assume that each person has a birthday in one of the 12 months, right? So, each person has 12 possible birth months. If we want to find the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months, we can model this as assigning each person a month without any overlap.

This seems like a problem that involves permutations or combinations. Wait, actually, since the order in which the people are born doesn't matter, it's more of a combinations problem. But actually, no, because each person is being assigned a specific month, so it's more like arranging 5 people into 12 months without any repeats.

So, for the first person, there are 12 possible months they could be born in. For the second person, since one month is already taken by the first person, there are only 11 months left. Similarly, the third person has 10 months available, the fourth has 9, and the fifth has 8. Therefore, the total number of ways to assign 5 unique months out of 12 is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me write that down.

Total number of favorable outcomes (all unique months) = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

Now, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways 5 people can each have a birth month, regardless of whether they share a month or not. Since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5. Let me check that.

Yes, for each of the 5 people, there are 12 choices, so 12 multiplied by itself 5 times is 12^5. So, the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

Probability(all unique) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / (12^5).

So, then the probability that at least 2 people share a birth month is 1 minus that probability. Let me write that formula.

Probability(at least 2 same) = 1 - Probability(all unique).

Alright, let me compute the numbers.

First, let's compute the numerator for the probability(all unique):

12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

Let me calculate that step by step:

12 × 11 = 132.

132 × 10 = 1320.

1320 × 9 = 11880.

11880 × 8 = 95040.

So, the numerator is 95040.

Now, the denominator is 12^5.

12^5 is 12 × 12 × 12 × 12 × 12.

Let me compute that:

12 × 12 = 144.

144 × 12 = 1728.

1728 × 12 = 20736.

20736 × 12 = 248832.

So, 12^5 is 248832.

Therefore, the probability(all unique) is 95040 / 248832.

Let me compute that fraction. Hmm, both numbers are divisible by 95040, so let me see:

95040 ÷ 95040 = 1.

248832 ÷ 95040 = 2.62... Wait, maybe I should simplify the fraction.

Alternatively, let me divide numerator and denominator by 95040:

Probability(all unique) = 1 / (248832 / 95040) = 1 / 2.62... Hmm, that's not helpful. Maybe I should just compute it as a decimal.

So, 95040 ÷ 248832.

Let me see, 248832 ÷ 95040 = approximately 2.62, so 1 / 2.62 is approximately 0.381.

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 95040 ÷ 48 = 1980; 248832 ÷ 48 = 5184.

So now, it's 1980 / 5184.
