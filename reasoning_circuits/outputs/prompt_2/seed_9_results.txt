<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I've got this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, sounds interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that probability problems often require figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are situations where at least two people were born in the same month. The total possible outcomes are all the different ways 5 people can be born in different months.

Wait, but actually, when the question says "at least 2," that usually means it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be that no two people were born in the same month, right? So, the probability that all five were born in different months. That might be easier because sometimes it's simpler to calculate probabilities for all being different.

Okay, so let me define this. Let me denote:

- Let A be the event that at least two people are born in the same month.
- Then, the complementary event, which is A', is that all five people are born in different months.

So, according to probability rules, P(A) = 1 - P(A').

Therefore, I need to compute P(A') and subtract that from 1 to find the probability that at least two share a birthday month.

Alright, so how do I calculate P(A')?

I know that when dealing with probabilities of all outcomes being unique, it's similar to permutations. So, if I have 5 people and 12 months, the number of ways they can be born in different months is equal to the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time.

Hmm, in combinatorics, the number of ways to arrange r items out of n is given by n! / (n - r)! So, in this case, n is 12 (months) and r is 5 (people). So, the number of favorable outcomes for A' would be 12P5.

Then, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of ways 5 people can be born in any of the 12 months without any restrictions. That would be 12^5, because each person can be born in any of the 12 months independently.

So, putting this together, P(A') = (12P5) / (12^5). Then, P(A) = 1 - P(A') = 1 - (12P5) / (12^5).

Hmm, wait a second, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Yes, the total number of ways to assign months to each person without restrictions is 12 choices for each person, so 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 = 12^5. On the other hand, the number of ways all five can have distinct months is 12 choices for the first person, 11 for the next, 10, 9, 8, so 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. Which is exactly 12P5, so yes, P(A') is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes I might see this written as probabilities step by step. Let me think.

For the first person, the probability doesn't matter because they can be born in any month. For the second person, the probability that they don't share a month with the first person is 11/12. For the third person, it would be 10/12, and so on.

So, in that case, P(A') would be calculated as the product of these probabilities:

(11/12) * (10/12) * (9/12) * (8/12) for 5 people.

Wait, so which method is correct? Is it better to use combinations or permutations?

Actually, both methods should give the same result, so let me verify that.

First method:

12P5 is 12*11*10*9*8 = 95040.

12^5 is 248832.

So, P(A') = 95040 / 248832.

Second method:

Multiplying the probabilities:

(11/12)*(10/12)*(9/12)*(8/12)*(7/12). Wait, hold on, did I write that correctly?

Wait, if we have 5 people, for the second person, it's 11/12; the third, 10/12; fourth, 9/12; fifth, 8/12. So that's actually (11/12)*(10/12)*(9/12)*(8/12).

So, 4 probabilities multiplied together.

So, let me compute both:

First method:

95040 /

Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I know that probability questions often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the scenarios where at least two people share the same birth month, and the total possible outcomes are all the different ways the five people could be born in any months.

But wait, when I think about it, calculating the probability of "at least two" can sometimes be tricky because there are multiple scenarios that satisfy this condition. Instead of calculating all those scenarios directly, maybe it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtracting from 1. The complementary event in this case would be that no two people share the same birth month, meaning all five people are born in different months.

Okay, so let me break it down:

1. **Total Number of Possible Outcomes:**
   - Each person can be born in any of the 12 months. So, for each person, there are 12 possibilities. Since there are 5 people, the total number of possible birth month combinations is \(12^5\).
   - Let me compute that: \(12 \times 12 \times 12 \times 12 \times 12\). Hmm, 12 squared is 144, cubed is 1728, to the fourth power is 20736, and to the fifth is 248832. So, total possible outcomes are 248,832.

2. **Number of Favorable Outcomes (All Different Months):**
   - For the complementary event where all five people are born in different months, we need to count how many ways this can happen.
   - Since there are 12 months, and we need to choose 5 different ones, this is a permutation problem. The number of ways to arrange 5 different months out of 12 is \(P(12,5)\), which is calculated as \(12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8\).
   - Let me compute that: 12 × 11 is 132, ×10 is 1320, ×9 is 11880, ×8 is 95,040. So, 95,040 favorable outcomes for the complementary event.

3. **Calculating the Probability of the Complementary Event:**
   - So, the probability that all five people are born in different months is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That is \( \frac{95,040}{248,832} \).
   - Let me compute that fraction: both numerator and denominator can be divided by 48. Let's see, 95,040 ÷ 48 is 1980, and 248,832 ÷48 is 5184. Hmm, maybe another common divisor? Let me check: 95,040 and 248,832. Both are divisible by 24? 95,040 ÷24= 3960, 248,832 ÷24= 10,368. Still, maybe I can simplify further. 3960 and 10,368. Let's see, both are divisible by 24 again: 3960 ÷24= 165, 10,368 ÷24= 432. Now, 165 and 432. They are both divisible by 3: 165 ÷3=55, 432 ÷3=144. So, simplified fraction is 55/144. So, the probability of all different months is 55/144.

4. **Calculating the Probability of the Desired Event:**
   - The probability that at least two people share the same birth month is 1 minus the probability that all five are born in different months.
   - So, that would be \(1 - \frac{55}{144}\). Calculating that: 144/144 - 55/144 = 89/144.

Wait, let me verify this because I think I might have messed up the calculations somewhere. Let me cross-check the numbers.

Total number of possible outcomes: 12^5 is indeed 248,832.

Number of favorable outcomes for all different months: 12 ×11×10×9×8 = 95,040. That seems right.

So, 95,040 / 248,832. Let me compute that as a decimal to see if it's 55/144.

95,040 ÷ 248,832. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 48: 95,040 ÷48= 1980, 248,832 ÷48= 5184.
