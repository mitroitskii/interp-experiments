<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps. The question is about the probability of at least two people being born in the same month. It mentions a group of 5 people, so I guess each person has a birthday in a month, and I need to calculate the chance that at least two share the same birth month.

Let me recall some probability concepts. Probability often involves figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the favorable outcomes are the scenarios where at least two people share the same birth month, and the total outcomes are all possible combinations of birth months for the five people.

But sometimes, calculating the probability of "at least" something is easier by considering the complement. That is, instead of calculating the probability of two or more people sharing a birthday month directly, it might be simpler to calculate the probability that no two people share the same birth month (i.e., all have unique birth months), and then subtract that probability from 1. That should give me the probability of at least two sharing a birth month.

Yeah, that sounds like a plan. So, let me proceed with that method.

First, let's figure out how many possible birth months there are. I assume we're talking about the usual 12 months of the year. So, each person can be born in any one of the 12 months.

Now, if we have five people, and we want the probability that all five have unique birth months, how would that work?

Well, for the first person, there's no restriction, so they can be born in any of the 12 months. For the second person, to avoid sharing a birth month with the first person, they can only be born in the remaining 11 months. Similarly, the third person must be born in a month different from the first two, so they have 10 choices, right? And the fourth person would have 9 choices, and the fifth person 8.

So, multiplying these together, the total number of ways the five people can all have unique birth months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me compute that.

12 × 11 is 132.

132 × 10 is 1320.

1320 × 9 is 11880.

11880 × 8 is 95040.

So, there are 95,040 possible ways for all five people to have unique birth months.

But wait, hold on a second. Is that the right way to compute the number of favorable outcomes? Hmm. Or should I actually think in terms of permutations here?

Yeah, exactly. Since the order of their birthdays matters here, we're dealing with permutations. So, the number of favorable outcomes where all are unique is indeed 12 permute 5, which is 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7! = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) = 95040.

Okay, that makes sense. Now, what is the total number of possible ways that the five people can have birthdays without any restrictions? Well, each person can be born in any of the 12 months, independently of the others. So, it's 12 choices for each of the five people.

That would be 12^5 total possibilities.

Let me calculate 12^5. 12 squared is 144, 144 × 12 is 1728, 1728 × 12 is 20736, 20736 × 12 is 248832. So, 12^5 is 248,832.

Therefore, the probability that all five people have unique birth months is the number of unique outcomes divided by total outcomes. So, that would be 95040 / 248832.

Let me compute that fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 48 to simplify. 95040 ÷ 48 is 1980, and 248832 ÷ 48 is 5184.

So, 1980 / 5184. Hmm, can that be simplified further? Let's see. Both numbers are divisible by 12. 1980 ÷ 12 is 165, and 5184 ÷ 12 is 432.

So now, we have 165 / 432. Are these numbers divisible by something? Let's check.

165 ÷ 3 is 55, and 432 ÷ 3 is 144.

So, that's 55 / 144. I don't think that reduces further because 55 is 5 × 11 and 144 is

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First off, I need to understand the problem properly. We have 5 people, and we want to find the probability that at least two of them were born in the same month. Hmm, so I guess this is a problem about calculating the probability of at least one pair sharing a birth month. 

I remember that in probability, when we're dealing with "at least" scenarios, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. So maybe I can calculate the probability that all 5 people were born in different months and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the probability that at least two were born in the same month. Yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, before jumping into that, I should consider the number of months in a year. There are 12 months, right? So, each person has 12 possible birth months. But actually, when we're dealing with birthdays, each month can occur more than once, but in this case, we're just considering the month, not the day. So, each person is assigned a month uniformly at random. 

So, the total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people is 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 12^5. Let me write that down:

Total number of possible outcomes = 12^5.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes for the complementary event, where all 5 people were born in different months, would be the number of ways to assign each person a unique month. Since there are 12 months, and we need to choose 5 distinct months for 5 people, that should be a permutation problem.

So, the number of ways to assign 5 different months to 5 people is P(12,5), which is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. Let me calculate that:

P(12,5) = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

Let me compute that step by step:

12 * 11 = 132

132 * 10 = 1320

1320 * 9 = 11880

11880 * 8 = 95040.

So, there are 95,040 ways where all 5 people have different birth months.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 people were born in different months is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 95,040 / (12^5).

Let me compute 12^5 to check:

12^1 = 12

12^2 = 144

12^3 = 1728

12^4 = 20736

12^5 = 248832.

So, the probability that all 5 people were born in different months is 95,040 / 248,832.

Let me compute that division:

First, let's simplify the fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 48, I think.

95,040 ÷ 48 = 1980

248,832 ÷ 48 = 5184

So, now we have 1980 / 5184.

Hmm, can we divide both by 12? 1980 ÷12=165, 5184 ÷12=432.

So, 165 / 432.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 165 ÷3=55, 432 ÷3=144.

So, 55/144.

Is that reducible? 55 is 5*11, and 144 is 12^2, which is 2^4*3^2. So, no common factors. Therefore, the probability that all 5 people were born in different months is 55/144.

Therefore, the probability that at least two people were born in the same month is 1 - 55/144.

Calculating that:

1 is 144/144, so 144/144 - 55/144 = 89/144.

So, is 89/144 the probability?

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Total number of possible outcomes: 12^5 = 248,832. That seems correct.

2. Number of ways all 5 can have different months: P(12,5) = 12*11*10*9*8 = 95,040. Hmm, that also seems correct.

3. Probability all different: 95,040 / 248,832. Then simplifying: divide numerator and denominator by
