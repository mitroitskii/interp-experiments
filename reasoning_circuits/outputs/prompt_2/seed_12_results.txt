<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out the chance that among five individuals, at least two share the same birth month. 

First, I think about probability basics. Probability is often about favorable outcomes over total outcomes. But sometimes, it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract that from 1. Since the question is about at least two people being born in the same month, the opposite would be all five people being born in different months. So, if I can find the probability that all five have unique birth months, I can subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.

Let me verify if that's correct. Yes, because if I don't consider the opposite event, calculating the probability directly might be more complicated due to multiple overlaps. It's often easier to compute the complementary probability.

So, to compute the complementary probability, I need to figure out how many ways all five people can be born in different months. But first, I should consider the months. There are 12 months in a year, so each person can be born in any of the 12 months. 

Wait a second, but if we are talking about the same month, the birth months are independent for each person, right? So, the birthdays don't influence each other in any way. So, is this a case of independent events? Maybe not directly, since each birthday is independent, but the problem is about combinations where at least two are the same.

So, thinking again, since each birthday is independent, I can model this as a problem of occupancy. We have 5 people (objects) and 12 months (boxes), and we want to distribute these 5 people into the 12 months. The question is, what is the probability that at least one box has more than one object (i.e., at least two people born in the same month). 

Alternatively, using probability theory, I can model this as permutations or combinations with repetition. Let's try to formalize it.

The total number of possible birthday combinations for 5 people is the number of ways to assign 5 distinct days out of 365, but since months are involved, perhaps it's just the number of ways to assign 5 months for each person. But actually, each person has a specific birthday, but since the problem only considers the month, the days don't matter. So, it's a matter of assigning each person to a month.

So, for each person, there are 12 possible months. Since each person's birthday is independent, the total number of possible combinations is 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, so 12^5. 

Now, how many of those combinations have all five people born in different months? That would be choosing 5 different months out of 12 and then assigning each person to one of those months. The number of ways to choose 5 different months is the combination C(12,5), and then for each such combination, there are 5! ways to assign the people to the months. So, the total number of favorable outcomes for all different months is C(12,5) multiplied by 5!.

Therefore, the probability that all five are born in different months is [C(12,5) * 5!] / 12^5. So, the probability we want is 1 minus that.

Let me write that out:

Probability(at least two same month) = 1 - [C(12,5) * 5! / 12^5]

Now, calculating each part:

First, let's compute C(12,5). That's the combination of 12 months taken 5 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).

So, C(12,5) = 12! / (5! * 7!) 

Calculating that: 12*11*10*9*8 / (5*4*3*2*1) = (95040) / (120) = 792

Wait, 12*11 is 132, 132*10 is 1320, 1320*9 is 11880, 11880*8 is 95040. Divided by 120, yes, 95040 / 120 is 792. So C(12,5)=792.

Then, 5! is 5 factorial, which is 120. So, 792 * 120 = 95040. 

Then, 12^5 is 12*12=144, 144*12=1728, 1728*12=20736, 20736*12=

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, let's see. I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably understand the problem. We have 5 people, and we want to find the probability that at least two of them were born in the same month. That means we don't want all 5 people to have unique birth months. Since there are 12 months in a year, each person could potentially be born in any of those 12 months.

Wait, does the problem specify anything about the months? Like, are there any restrictions? No, it just says "born in the same month," so I think we can assume that each person's birth month is independent and uniformly distributed among the 12 months.

So, probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the number of ways that at least two people share a birth month, and the total outcomes are all possible ways the 5 people can be born.

Hmm, but calculating "at least two" can sometimes be tricky. It might be easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtracting from 1. The complementary event of "at least two people share a month" is "all five people have different birth months." So, if I can find the probability that all five are born in different months, then subtract that from 1, I'll have the desired probability.

Yes, that seems like a solid approach. Let me write that down.

Probability(at least 2 share a month) = 1 - Probability(all five have different months)

So, now I need to compute Probability(all five have different months). How do I do that?

Well, for the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, to have a different month than the first, there are 11 choices. For the third person, 10 choices, and so on, decreasing by one each time because each subsequent person must choose a different month.

So, for the first person: 12 months.
Second person: 11 months.
Third person: 10 months.
Fourth person: 9 months.
Fifth person: 8 months.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. If the first person has 12 options, the second person must choose from the remaining 11, the third from the remaining 10, etc., so yes, that's correct. So the number of ways all five can have different months is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

But wait, is this permutations? Because the order matters here. So, the total number of possible birth month combinations for five people is 12^5, since each person independently has 12 choices. So, the probability that all five have different months is (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (12^5). Then, the probability that at least two share a month is 1 minus that.

Let me compute that.

First, let's compute the numerator: 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8.

12 * 11 is 132.

132 * 10 is 1320.

1320 * 9 is 11880.

11880 * 8 is 95040.

So, the numerator is 95040.

Now, the denominator is 12^5. Let's compute that.

12^1 is 12.

12^2 is 144.

12^3 is 1728.

12^4 is 20736.

12^5 is 248832.

So, the probability that all five have different months is 95040 / 248832.

Let me compute that fraction.

95040 divided by 248832.

Hmm, let's see. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 95040.

95040 / 95040 = 1.

248832 / 95040 = let's see.

248832 divided by 95040.

First, note that 95040 * 2 = 190080.

Subtract that from 248832: 248832 - 190080 = 58752.

Now, 95040 goes into 58752 how many times? It doesn't, because 95040 is larger than 58752. So, the fraction reduces to 1/2.628... Hmm, maybe I should find a better way.

Alternatively, let me compute 95040 / 248832.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 95040 /48 = 1980, 248832 /48=5184.

So, 1980 /5184.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12:
