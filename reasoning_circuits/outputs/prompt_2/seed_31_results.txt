<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First off, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to combinatorics and figuring out the right approach. I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event happening and then subtracting that from 1. So in this case, the opposite of "at least 2 born in the same month" would be "all 5 people were born in different months." Hmm, that might be a manageable calculation.

But before jumping into that, let me recall some basics. There are 12 months in a year, so each person could potentially be born in any of these 12 months. The birthday problem, which is similar, often assumes that birthdays are evenly distributed across the year, which I think is a safe assumption here unless stated otherwise.

So, if I think about each person's birthday as an independent event, each with 12 possible outcomes (Jan, Feb, ..., Dec), then the total number of possible birthday combinations for 5 people would be 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 12^5. Let me compute that: 12*12 is 144, 144*12 is 1728, 1728*12 is 20736, and 20736*12 is 248832. So, 248,832 total possible combinations.

Now, if I want to find the probability that all 5 people were born in different months, that means each person has a unique birth month. So, the first person can be born in any of the 12 months, the second person must be born in one of the remaining 11 months, the third person in one of the remaining 10 months, the fourth in 9, and the fifth in 8. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 12*11*10*9*8.

Let me compute that: 12*11 is 132, 132*10 is 1320, 1320*9 is 11880, and 11880*8 is 95,040. So, there are 95,040 ways where all 5 have unique birth months.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 were born in different months is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So that's 95,040 / 248,832.

Let me simplify that fraction. First, let's see if both numbers are divisible by 48. 95,040 ÷ 48 is 1980, and 248,832 ÷ 48 is 5184. Hmm, okay, so now we have 1980 / 5184. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1980 ÷ 12 is 165, and 5184 ÷ 12 is 432. So now it's 165 / 432. I can divide numerator and denominator by 3: 165 ÷ 3 is 55, and 432 ÷ 3 is 144. So, 55/144.

Is that reducible? Let me check. 55 is 5*11, and 144 is 12 squared, which is 2^4 *3^2. So, no, that's the simplest form. So, 55/144 is approximately 0.3819, or 38.19%.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 were born in different months is about 38.19%. So, the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month is 1 minus that, right? So, 1 - 55/144.

Calculating that: 55/144 is approximately 0.3819, so 1 - 0.3819 is approximately 0.6181, which is about 61.81%.

Wait, hold on, that seems high. Let me verify the numbers again.

Total number of possible birthday combinations is indeed 12^5, which is 248,832. That's correct. For all 5 being different, it's 12P5, which is 12*11*10*9*8, which we calculated as 95,040. Divided by 248,832, that gives approximately 0.3819.

So, 1 - 0.3819 is 0.6181, or 61.81%. Hmm, that does seem high, but considering the number of people, maybe it is. Let me think about the classic birthday problem with 23 people, which has a 50% chance. So, with 5 people, 38% chance of all different,

Alright, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that probability questions can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to "at least" scenarios. I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. So, in this case, instead of directly calculating the probability that at least two people share the same birth month, maybe I can find the probability that all five people have different birth months and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the desired probability. Let me note that down.

So, Probability(at least 2 same month) = 1 - Probability(all different months). That makes sense because if I can find the probability that everyone is born in a different month, then the complement will be the probability that at least two share a month.

Now, I need to figure out the Probability(all different months). For this, I should probably consider the number of possible ways the five people can be born in different months and divide that by the total number of possible ways they can be born in any months.

Wait, but how many months are there? There are 12 months in a year, right? So, if I have 5 people, each can be born in any of the 12 months. But since we want all different months, we need to consider how many ways this can happen.

This sounds like a permutation problem because the order matters here. Each person is a distinct individual, so if the first person is born in January, the second in February, the third in March, etc., that's different from the second person being born in January and the first in February. So, permutations are the right approach.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to assign 5 different months out of 12 to 5 people. The formula for permutations is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 12 months, and k is 5 people.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is P(12, 5) = 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7!.

But wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each person is being assigned a unique month, so for the first person, there are 12 choices, for the second person, 11 choices (since one month is already taken), for the third person, 10 choices, and so on until the fifth person, who has 8 choices. So, actually, the number of favorable outcomes is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. That seems correct because it's the same as 12P5, which is 12! / 7!.

Okay, so that's the numerator. Now, the denominator is the total number of possible outcomes, which is the total number of ways the 5 people can be born in any months without any restrictions. Since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, and each month is independent, the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5. Because for each person, there are 12 choices, and there are 5 people.

So, putting it all together, the probability that all five people have different birth months is:

Probability(all different months) = (12P5) / (12^5) = (12! / 7!) / (12^5).

Therefore, the probability that at least two people share the same birth month is:

Probability(at least 2 same month) = 1 - (12P5 / 12^5) = 1 - (12! / 7! / 12^5).

Hmm, okay, so that's the formula, but let me compute it numerically to get a better sense.

First, let me compute 12P5. 12P5 is 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. Let me calculate that:

12 * 11 = 132
132 * 10 = 1320
1320 * 9 = 11880
11880 * 8 = 95040

So, 12P5 is 95040.

Next, 12^5 is 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12. Let me compute that:

12 * 12 = 144
144 * 12 = 1728
1728 * 12 = 20736
20736 * 12 = 248832

So, 12^5 is 248832.
