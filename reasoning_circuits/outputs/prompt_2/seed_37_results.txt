<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving combinations where order doesn't matter, I should use combinations. So, since we have a group of 5 people, the total number of possible ways they can be born in different months is going to be based on the number of months in a year. I think there are 12 months, right? So each person could be born in any of the 12 months.

But wait, the problem says "at least 2 were born in the same month." So, I need to find the probability that in those 5 people, at least two share the same birth month. Calculating "at least" probabilities can sometimes be tricky because it's easier to calculate the complement probability and then subtract it from 1.

Let me recall, the complement of "at least two born in the same month" is "all five people born in different months." So, if I find the probability that all five are born in different months, I can subtract that probability from 1 to get the desired probability.

Okay, so let's define:

- Total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people: ?
- Number of favorable outcomes where all are born in different months: ?
- Then, the probability of all being in different months is the number of favorable divided by total.
- Then, subtract that probability from 1 to get the probability of at least two sharing a month.

First, let's compute the total number of possible combinations. Since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, and each person's birth month is independent, it might be tempting to say it's 12^5. But wait, no. Actually, since the order doesn't matter, each person is just assigned a month without considering order, so it's a combination with repetition.

Wait, I need to be precise here. When we have independent events with replacement, the total number is 12^5. But when we are considering the group of people, their birth months are just a selection, so if order doesn't matter, it's equivalent to selecting 5 months with repetition allowed, so the number is indeed 12^5. However, wait, actually, is it 12^5 or is it different?

Wait, no. Each person is assigned a month, so if we consider that, each person has 12 choices, so the number of possible assignments is 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 = 12^5. But in terms of groupings, because the people are distinguishable, each different assignment is a different outcome. So maybe it's correct.

Wait, actually, no. Hmm. No, wait, in probability, when we compute the number of favorable outcomes, if the people are distinguishable, each different distribution of months is a different outcome. So, actually, yes, the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5, because each person can be born in any month, and we have 5 people, so 12 options for each, independent.

Wait, but I think another way to think about it is: When selecting 5 people and assigning each a month, it's the same as permutations with repetition. But in this case, since each person is distinct, we can consider each assignment as a different outcome.

Wait, to clarify, if we are selecting 5 months for 5 people, and the people are distinguishable, the total number of ways is 12^5. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes where all are in different months is equal to the number of ways to choose 5 different months out of 12 and then assign each month to a person.

So, first, choose 5 different months out of 12: that's C(12, 5). Then, for each such selection, assign each month to a person. Since the people are distinguishable, we need to assign each selected month to a specific person. That would be 5! ways.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(12,5) multiplied by 5!.

Therefore, the probability that all are born in different months is [C(12,5) * 5!] / 12^5.

Then, to find the probability that at least two share a month, we take 1 minus that probability.

So, let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate C(12,5). Combinations formula is C(n, k) = n! / [k! (n - k)!]. So, C(12,5) = 12! /

Alright, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that probability problems often involve figuring out the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. So, maybe I should start by understanding the total number of ways the 5 people could be born in different months. Then, I can find the probability that at least two share the same month by subtracting the probability that all five are born in different months from 1.

Wait, actually, let me think about the months first. There are 12 months in a year, right? So, each person has a birthday in one of these 12 months. So, for each person, there are 12 possible months they could be born in. Since we're dealing with probabilities, I should consider each person's birthday as an independent event with 12 possible outcomes.

Okay, so if I have 5 people, each with 12 possible months, the total number of possible combinations would be 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 12^5. Let me write that down: Total possible outcomes = 12^5.

Now, the next part is figuring out the number of favorable outcomes where at least two people share the same month. Hmm, but calculating "at least two" can sometimes be tricky. I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtracting from 1. The complementary event in this case would be that all five people have birthdays in different months. So, if I can find the probability that all five are born in different months, then subtracting that from 1 will give me the probability that at least two share the same month.

Okay, so let's compute the probability that all five people are born in different months. For the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, to avoid the same month as the first, there are 11 months left. Similarly, the third person has 10 months, the fourth has 9, and the fifth has 8 months. So, the number of ways all five can have different months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

Let me write that down: Number of favorable outcomes for all different months = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

Therefore, the probability that all five are born in different months is that number divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / 12^5.

Simplifying that, 12^5 is 12 × 12 × 12 × 12 × 12, which is 248832. Wait, let me actually compute that: 12 × 12 is 144, 144 × 12 is 1728, 1728 × 12 is 20736, and 20736 × 12 is 248832. Yep, that's correct.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes for all different months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me compute that: 12 × 11 is 132, 132 × 10 is 1320, 1320 × 9 is 11880, and 11880 × 8 is 95040. So, 95040.

So, the probability that all five are born in different months is 95040 / 248832. Let me simplify that fraction. Dividing numerator and denominator by 95040: 95040 ÷ 95040 is 1, and 248832 ÷ 95040 is approximately 2.624. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should divide numerator and denominator by 95040.

Wait, actually, let me compute 95040 divided by 248832. Let's see: 248832 ÷ 95040 equals approximately 2.624, so 1 / 2.624 is approximately 0.381. So, the probability that all five are born in different months is approximately 0.381, or 38.1%.

But I should probably express this as an exact fraction. Let me see: 95040 / 248832. Both numbers can be divided by 95040: 95040 ÷ 95040 = 1, and 248832 ÷ 95040 = 2.624. Hmm, but 248832 divided by 95040 is 2.624, but that's a decimal. Maybe I can factor both numbers to simplify the fraction.

Let's factor 95040 and 248832.

First, 95040: I
