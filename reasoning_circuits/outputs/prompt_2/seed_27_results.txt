<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I need to understand the problem. It's asking for the probability that in a group of 5 people, at least two have their birthday in the same month. That means I have to calculate the chance that either two, three, four, or all five share the same birth month. But maybe there's a better way to approach this without calculating all those possibilities separately.

I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. The opposite event here would be that no two people share the same birth month. So if I can find the probability that all five people are born in different months, then 1 minus that probability will be the desired probability.

Okay, so let's try that approach. The probability we want is P(at least two share a month) = 1 - P(all five are in different months). Now, let's figure out how to compute P(all five are in different months).

First, let's consider that there are 12 months in a year. So for the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, we need them to be born in a different month than the first, so there are 11 months left. Similarly, for the third person, it should be different from the first two, so 10 months, and so on.

Wait, but does the order matter here? Because when calculating probability for independent events, the order usually doesn't matter. So, maybe I can think of it as a permutation problem. So, the number of ways to arrange 5 people each with a different birth month out of 12 months.

So, the total number of possible birthday combinations is 12 choices for the first person, 11 for the second, 10 for the third, 9 for the fourth, and 8 for the fifth. So, that would be 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Is that right? Hmm, let me verify.

Yes, that's correct because we're considering each person's birthday as a permutation without repetition. Alternatively, it can be written as 12P5, which is 12! / (12-5)! = 12! / 7!.

Now, what's the total number of possible birthday combinations without any restrictions? For each person, there are 12 possible months, and since there are 5 people, it should be 12^5. Let me check that. Yeah, for each of the 5 people, 12 choices, so 12 multiplied by itself 5 times. That's the total number of equally likely outcomes.

So, P(all five are in different months) is (12P5) / (12^5). That simplifies to (12! / (12 - 5)!) / 12^5, which is (12! / 7!) / 12^5. Okay, so that's the numerator. The denominator is 12^5.

Then, the probability we want is 1 minus that. So, P(at least two share a month) = 1 - (12P5) / (12^5). 

Let me write that more clearly. 

Total number of ways all five can have different birth months: 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 = 95040.

Total number of possible birthday combinations: 12^5 = 248832.

So, the probability that all five are born in different months is 95040 / 248832.

Now, let's compute that fraction to see what it equals. Let me calculate 95040 divided by 248832.

First, divide numerator and denominator by 95040: 

95040 / 95040 = 1

248832 / 95040 = approximately 2.62 (Wait, that doesn't seem precise. Maybe I can simplify the fraction differently.)

Alternatively, let's factor both numbers to simplify:

95040 = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me compute that:

12 × 11 = 132

132 × 10 = 1320

1320 × 9 = 11880

11880 × 8 = 95040.

So, 95040 = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

Similarly, 12^5 = 12 × 12 × 12 × 12 × 12 = 12^5.

I can factor 95040 / 12^5 as:

95040 = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8

Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I remember that probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to "at least" scenarios. Maybe I can approach this using the complementary probability. Instead of calculating the probability that at least two people share the same birth month directly, I can find the probability that all five people have different birth months and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the desired probability. 

So, let me break it down. The total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people is... Hmm, how many months are there? There are 12 months in a year, right? So, for the first person, there are 12 possible months they could be born in. For the second person, it's also 12 months, but since we want all different, it would be 11 months for the second person, 10 for the third, 9 for the fourth, and 8 for the fifth. 

Wait, let me make sure. If we're looking for all different months, it's a permutation problem. So, the number of ways to arrange 5 different birth months out of 12 is 12P5, which is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me compute that. 

12 × 11 is 132, 132 × 10 is 1320, 1320 × 9 is 11880, and 11880 × 8 is 95040. So, 95040 possible ways for all five people to have different birth months. 

Now, the total number of possible ways for the five people's birth months without any restrictions is 12^5. Let me calculate that as well. 12 × 12 is 144, 144 × 12 is 1728, 1728 × 12 is 20736, and 20736 × 12 is 248832. So, 248,832 total possible combinations. 

Therefore, the probability that all five people were born in different months is the number of favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 95040 / 248832. Let me simplify that fraction. 

First, let's see if both numbers can be divided by 48. 95040 ÷ 48 is 1980, and 248832 ÷ 48 is 5184. So, now we have 1980 / 5184. Let me see if this can be simplified further. Both numbers are divisible by 12. 1980 ÷ 12 is 165, and 5184 ÷ 12 is 432. So, now it's 165 / 432. 

Can we divide this further? 165 and 432 are both divisible by 3. 165 ÷ 3 is 55, and 432 ÷ 3 is 144. So, now we have 55 / 144. I think that's the simplest form. 

So, the probability that all five people were born in different months is 55/144. Therefore, the probability that at least two people were born in the same month is 1 minus that. 

Let me compute that: 1 - 55/144 is equal to (144/144 - 55/144) which is 89/144. So, is that the final answer? Wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a calculation error.

Starting from the beginning: calculating the number of ways for all different birth months. 12P5 is indeed 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8, which is 95040. Total possible outcomes are 12^5, which is 248832. Then, 95040 / 248832 simplifies to 55/144. That seems correct.

Wait, let me verify the simplification steps again. 95040 divided by 248832. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 95040: numerator becomes 1, denominator becomes 248832 / 95040, which is 2.618... Hmm, that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's see what 95040 × 2 is 190080, which is less than 248832. So, 95040 × 2.618... Hmm, maybe my initial approach was better.

Wait, perhaps I should use prime factors to simplify the fraction. Let's factor 95040 and 248832.

95040: Let's divide by 10: 9504. 9504 ÷ 2 = 4752, ÷2=2376, ÷2=1188
