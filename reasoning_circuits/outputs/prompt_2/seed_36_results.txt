<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let's see. I remember that probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps.

First, I need to figure out the total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people. Since there are 12 months, each person can be born in any of the 12 months. So for each person, there are 12 possibilities. Since the birthdays are independent, the total number of possible combinations should be 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, right? So that's 12^5. Let me calculate that: 12 * 12 is 144, 144 *12 is 1728, 1728 *12 is 20736, and 20736 *12 is 248832. So, total possible birthday combinations are 248,832.

Now, the problem asks for the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month. Hmm, "at least 2" sounds a bit broad. I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtracting from 1. The opposite event here would be that no two people share the same birth month, meaning all 5 birthdays are in different months. That way, if I can find the probability that all birthdays are distinct, I can subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least two share the same month.

Okay, so let me try that. How do I find the number of ways all 5 birthdays are in different months? Well, for the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, they need to be born in a different month, so that's 11 possibilities. For the third person, 10 possibilities, and so on until the fifth person, who would have 8 possibilities. So, that's 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8. Let me compute that step by step.

12 * 11 is 132. 132 * 10 is 1320. 1320 * 9 is 11,880. 11,880 * 8 is 95,040. So, the number of favorable outcomes where all birthdays are different is 95,040.

Therefore, the probability that all birthdays are in different months is 95,040 divided by the total number of possible combinations, which was 248,832. So, let's compute that: 95,040 / 248,832.

Hmm, let's see if that simplifies. Dividing numerator and denominator by 48: 95,040 ÷ 48 is 1,980, and 248,832 ÷ 48 is 5,184. So, 1,980 / 5,184. Hmm, let me see if that can be reduced further. Dividing both by 12: 1,980 ÷12 is 165, 5,184 ÷12 is 432. 165/432. Hmm, are there any common divisors? 165 is 5*33, which is 5*3*11. 432 is 16*27, which is 16*3*9. So, the only common divisor is 3. So, dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 165 ÷3 is 55, 432 ÷3 is 144. So, that simplifies to 55/144. Hmm, 55 divided by 144 is approximately 0.3819 or 38.19%.

Wait, hold on. I thought the probability of all birthdays being unique would be lower, but 38% seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.

Total number of possible birthday combinations: 12^5 is 248,832. That seems correct because 12*12*12*12*12 is indeed 248,832.

Number of ways all birthdays are different: 12 * 11 *10 *9 *8 = 95,040. Let me verify that. Yeah, 12P5 is 12!/(12-5)! which is 12*11*10*9*8. That’s 95,040. So, that seems correct too.

So, 95,040 / 248,832: Let me try doing this division step by step. 95,040 divided by 248,832. Let me see, how many times does 248,832 go into 95,040? Less than once, so 0. Divide 95,040 by 248,832. Let's convert to decimal.

95,040 ÷ 248,832 ≈ Let me compute that: Divide numerator and denominator by 48 first,

Okay, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps. The question is asking for the probability that at least two people share the same birth month. That means either exactly two people share a month, or more than two. So, it's not just about pairs; it's about any number of people sharing a month.

I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving combinations, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtracting from 1. The opposite event in this case would be that no two people share the same birth month, meaning all five people have distinct birth months.

So, let's formalize that. Let P(at least two) be the probability we want. Then, the probability that no two people share a birth month is 1 - P(at least two). Therefore, P(at least two) = 1 - P(all different). That seems like a good approach.

Now, let's figure out how many possible ways the five people can be born in different months. There are 12 months in a year, right? So, if each person is born in a different month, we need to assign each of the five people to a unique month. That sounds like a permutation problem.

Wait, actually, it's more like choosing without replacement. For the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, since one month is already taken, there are 11 months left. Similarly, the third person would have 10 months available, the fourth person 9, and the fifth person 8 months left. So, the total number of ways to assign different months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

Let me compute that: 12 × 11 is 132, 132 × 10 is 1320, 1320 × 9 is 11880, 11880 × 8 is 95040. So, there are 95,040 possible ways where all five people have different birth months.

But wait, hold on a second. Is this considering the order? Because when we count permutations like this, we are considering the order of births, right? But in reality, the problem doesn't specify any order. It just says a group of five people. Hmm, does that matter?

Let me think. The problem is about probability, so when we calculate the total number of possible outcomes, it's usually considering all possible combinations, not ordered. So, perhaps I need to adjust for that.

In probability, when calculating probabilities for such problems, sometimes we use combinations rather than permutations because the order doesn't matter. So, maybe instead of 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8, I should be using combinations.

But wait, no. Because when we're calculating the number of favorable outcomes for "all different months," each person is a separate entity, so the order does matter in the sense that each person is distinct. So, maybe permutations are the right way to go here.

Alternatively, we can think of it as the number of injective functions from the set of people to the set of months. Since each person must map to a unique month, it's injective, so the number is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8, which is 95,040.

Now, the total number of possible ways the five people can be born without any restrictions is 12^5, because each person can be born in any of the 12 months, independently. Let me compute that: 12^5 is 12 × 12 × 12 × 12 × 12.

12 × 12 is 144, 144 × 12 is 1728, 1728 × 12 is 20736, 20736 × 12 is 248,832. So, 248,832 total possible combinations.

Therefore, the probability that all five people have different birth months is the number of injective mappings divided by the total number of mappings. So, that's 95,040 / 248,832. Let me compute that fraction.

First, let's see if we can simplify it. Both numbers are divisible by 48? Let me check: 95,040 ÷ 48 is 1,980, and 248,832 ÷ 48 is 5,184. Hmm, 1,980 / 5,184. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1,980 ÷ 12 is 165, and 5,184 ÷ 12 is 432. 165 / 432 can be simplified
