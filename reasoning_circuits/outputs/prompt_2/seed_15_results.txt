<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I’ve got this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down often helps. The question is asking about the probability that at least two people share the same birth month out of a group of five. That makes me think about combinations and maybe using the pigeonhole principle. Hmm, but I need to calculate it step by step.

So, let me outline what I know. There are 12 months in a year, right? So, each person can be thought of as being assigned to one of 12 "pigeonholes." We have 5 people, so we’re distributing 5 pigeons into 12 holes. The question is about the probability that at least two pigeons end up in the same hole.

But wait, when calculating probability, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtracting from 1. The complementary event here would be that no two people share the same birth month. That is, all five people are born in different months.

Yeah, that makes sense. So, the probability we want is 1 minus the probability that all five are born in different months. Cool, that should simplify things a bit.

Okay, so now I need to figure out the probability that all five people are born in different months. How do I do that? Well, the first person can be born in any month, so the probability is 1. The second person needs to be born in a different month than the first. Since there are 12 months, the second person has 11 choices. The third person needs to be born in a different month than the first two, so 10 choices. The fourth person has 9 choices, and the fifth person has 8 choices. Wait, but hold on—this is considering ordered events, right? Like, for each subsequent person, the number of available months decreases by one.

But in reality, the order in which we pick the months doesn't matter because the births are independent events. Hmm, so maybe I should be using combinations instead of permutations here.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of selection. The number of ways to choose 5 different months out of 12 is given by the combination formula, which is C(12,5). Then, for each of those combinations, each person can be assigned to a different month. So, how does that translate into probability?

Wait, actually, the probability of all five being born in different months can be thought of as assigning each person a unique month, one after the other. So, the first person has 12 possible months, the second has 11, the third has 10, the fourth has 9, and the fifth has 8. So, that would be 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 possible ways. But that's permutations, isn't it?

But in probability, if each month is equally likely, we can consider the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is 12^5 because each person has 12 choices independently. Alternatively, if considering order, we can use the permutation approach, but since order doesn't matter in the selection of months, we can either use combinations or permutations.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. The problem is about assigning each person a month, so each person is independent, right? So, the total number of possible outcomes is indeed 12^5 because each person has 12 choices. That’s 12 options for each of the five people, so 12 multiplied by itself five times.

Then, the number of favorable outcomes where all five have different months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Because for the first person, it doesn't matter which month they choose, so 12 options, but then for the second person, it has to be a different month, so 11, and so on until the fifth person who has only 8 months left.

But wait, actually, 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 is equal to 12P5, which is the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time. So, it counts the number of ordered arrangements where each of the five people has a unique month. But since each outcome in the probability is equally likely, regardless of order, we can still use this number as the numerator.

So, if I take the number of favorable outcomes where all five are unique and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes, I get the probability that all five are born in different months. Then, subtracting that from 1 gives me the

Alright, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving "at least" scenarios, it can sometimes be easier to calculate the complementary probability and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be that no two people were born in the same month, meaning all five people have unique birth months. So, if I can find the probability that all five birthdays are unique, I can subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least two share a month.

But wait, how many months are there? There are 12 months in a year, right? So, if we're talking about birthdays, each person's birthday can be represented by a number from 1 to 12, corresponding to the month. That makes sense.

Now, let's break it down. Let's assume that each person's birthday is equally likely to be any of the 12 months. So, the probability distribution is uniform. That means for each person, the probability of being born in any particular month is 1/12.

Okay, so if I have five people, each with a birthday in one of the 12 months, what's the probability that all five have different months? That's the complementary probability I was thinking about.

To calculate this, I think it's similar to the problem of counting the number of ways to assign each person a unique month, divided by the total number of possible birthday combinations.

So, the total number of possible birthday combinations for five people is 12 choices for the first person, 12 for the second, and so on, up to 12 for the fifth person. So, that would be 12^5 total possible combinations.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes where all birthdays are unique. For the first person, there are 12 choices. For the second person, since they must be different from the first, there are 11 choices. For the third person, 10 choices, and so on, down to 8 choices for the fifth person.

So, the number of unique birthday combinations is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me compute that.

12 × 11 is 132, 132 × 10 is 1320, 1320 × 9 is 11880, and 11880 × 8 is 95040. So, there are 95,040 unique birthday combinations where all five people have different birth months.

Therefore, the probability that all five have different birth months is the number of unique combinations divided by the total number of possible combinations. That is 95040 / (12^5). Let me compute 12^5 as well.

12^1 is 12, 12^2 is 144, 12^3 is 1728, 12^4 is 20736, and 12^5 is 248832. So, 95,040 / 248,832. Let me simplify that fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 95040 ÷ 48 is 1980, and 248832 ÷ 48 is 5184. So, 1980 / 5184. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1980 ÷ 12 is 165, and 5184 ÷ 12 is 432. So, 165 / 432.

Can I simplify further? Let's see. Both are divisible by 3: 165 ÷ 3 is 55, 432 ÷ 3 is 144. So, 55 / 144. That's approximately 0.3819, or 38.19%.

So, the probability that all five people have unique birth months is about 38.19%. Therefore, the probability that at least two share a birth month is 1 minus that, which is 1 - 0.3819 = 0.6181, or 61.81%.

But wait, let me verify that. Maybe I made a calculation error somewhere.

Alternatively, another way to compute the number of unique birthday combinations is using permutations. Since we are assigning each person a unique month, it's a permutation of 12 months taken 5 at a time, which is 12P5, equal to 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7!.

12! is 479001600, and 7! is 5040. So, 479001600 / 5040 is equal to 95040, which matches what I had before. So, that's correct.

Total number of possible birthday combinations is 12^5, which is 248
