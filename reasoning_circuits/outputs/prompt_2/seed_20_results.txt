<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, alright, let's try to figure this out.

First off, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can break this down. The question is about probability, specifically the chance that at least two people share a birth month. Since there are 12 months in a year, each person can be thought of as being assigned one of 12 possibilities (their birth month). 

I recall that when dealing with probabilities involving "at least" or "at most," sometimes it's easier to calculate the complementary probability and then subtract it from 1. So, in this case, instead of directly finding the probability that at least two people share a month, maybe I can find the probability that no two people share a month, and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the probability that at least two do share a month. Let me see if that makes sense.

So, let's define the problem more formally. Let me denote each person's birth month as an independent event with 12 possible outcomes (January through December). Since each person is independent, the number of possible outcomes for all 5 people is 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 12^5. That makes sense because each person can be born in any month, regardless of the others.

Now, for the complementary probability where no two people share a birth month. This is similar to the problem of assigning each person a unique birth month, meaning all 5 people have distinct months. Since there are 12 months, the number of ways this can happen is the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time, which is denoted as P(12, 5). 

The formula for permutations is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, so plugging in the numbers, that would be P(12, 5) = 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7! 

Let me compute that. 12! is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7! So, 12! / 7! = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) × (7! / 7!) = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Calculating that:

12 × 11 = 132

132 × 10 = 1320

1320 × 9 = 11880

11880 × 8 = 95040

So, P(12,5) = 95040. That means there are 95040 ways for all 5 people to have unique birth months.

Now, the total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people is 12^5. Let me compute that as well. 12^5 is 12 × 12 × 12 × 12 × 12.

Calculating step by step:

12 × 12 = 144

144 × 12 = 1728

1728 × 12 = 20736

20736 × 12 = 248832

So, 12^5 is 248,832.

Thus, the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months is 95040 / 248832.

Let me simplify that fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 95040. Let me compute 248832 ÷ 95040 to find the factor.

248832 ÷ 95040 ≈ 2.622... Hmm, that's not exact. Maybe I can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of both numbers. Let me list the prime factors:

95040: let's factorize 95040.

Start by dividing by 10: 95040 = 9504 × 10 = (9504) × (2 × 5). Now factorizing 9504: 9504 ÷ 2 = 4752; 4752 ÷ 2 = 2376; 2376 ÷ 2 = 1188; 1188 ÷ 2 = 594; 594 ÷ 2 = 297. So that's 2^5. Now 297: 297 ÷ 3 = 99; 99 ÷ 3 = 33; 33 ÷ 3 = 11. So 3^3 × 11. 

Putting it all together, 95040 = 2^5 × 3^3 × 5 × 11.

Now, 248832. Let's factorize that.

248832 ÷ 2 = 124416

124416 ÷ 2 =

Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving "at least" or "at least one," it's often easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be that no two people were born in the same month, right? So, if I can find the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months, then subtracting that from 1 should give me the desired probability.

Let me jot that down:

Probability(at least 2 born in same month) = 1 - Probability(all 5 born in different months)

Okay, now I need to figure out Probability(all 5 born in different months). To do this, I should consider the number of ways the 5 people can be born in different months divided by the total number of possible birth month combinations.

First, let's think about the months. There are 12 months in a year, so each person has 12 possible birth months. But wait, since we're dealing with people, the order in which they are born doesn't matter, right? So, this is a problem of combinations, not permutations.

So, the total number of possible birth month combinations for 5 people is the number of ways to assign 5 different months out of 12. That should be calculated using combinations, which is denoted as C(12,5) or sometimes as \(\binom{12}{5}\).

Let me calculate that:

\[
\binom{12}{5} = \frac{12!}{5!(12-5)!} = \frac{12!}{5!7!}
\]

Calculating that:

12! is 12×11×10×9×8×7! so we can cancel out the 7! in numerator and denominator:

\[
\binom{12}{5} = \frac{12×11×10×9×8}{5×4×3×2×1} = \frac{95040}{120} = 792
\]

So, the total number of possible birth month combinations is 792.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes where all 5 people have unique birth months is the number of ways to assign each person a different month. Since there are 12 months, we need to choose 5 distinct months and assign each month to one person.

This is similar to permutations, where order matters, but in this case, since each person is distinct, it's actually a permutation of 12 months taken 5 at a time. Wait, is that correct? Or is it just combinations?

Hold on, no. Since each person is unique, the order in which their months are assigned does matter in terms of the total number of possible assignments. So, actually, it's a permutation problem.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

When we're dealing with assigning months to people, each person can be assigned any month, but we want all months to be unique. So, it's like choosing 5 different months out of 12 and then assigning each month to one person.

So, first, choose 5 months out of 12, which is \(\binom{12}{5}\), and then assign each of these 5 months to the 5 people. Since the people are distinct, the assignment is a permutation, so that's 5! ways.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is:

\[
\binom{12}{5} \times 5!
\]

Wait, let me verify that. If we have 12 months and we need to assign 5 distinct months to 5 people, the number of ways is indeed \(\binom{12}{5}\) for choosing the months and then 5! for assigning them to the people. So, yes, that makes sense.

So, let's compute that:

First, we already have \(\binom{12}{5} = 792\).

Then, 5! is 120.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 792 × 120.

Calculating that:

792 × 120. Hmm, 792 × 100 is 79,200 and 792 × 20 is 15,840. So, adding those together: 79,200 + 15,840 = 95,040.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is 95,040.

Now, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways 5 people can be born in any months, regardless of repetition. Since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, and the births are independent,
