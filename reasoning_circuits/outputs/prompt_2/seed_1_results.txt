<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the problem. We have 5 people, and we want to find the probability that at least 2 of them were born in the same month. That means we're looking for the chance that two or more people share the same birth month. Got it.

I remember that probability questions often involve figuring out the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. So, maybe I should use combinations here because the order in which people are born doesn't matter. It's all about the groupings of people by their birth months.

Let me recall, the total number of possible ways 5 people can be born in any months is related to permutations or combinations? Since each person has 12 possible months, but since we don't care about the order, it's a combination with repetition problem. Wait, is that right?

Yes, when we're dealing with groups where the order doesn't matter and repetition is allowed (because multiple people can be born in the same month), we use combinations with repetition. The formula for the number of ways to distribute n indistinguishable objects into k distinguishable boxes is C(n + k - 1, k - 1). In this case, n is 5 people and k is 12 months. So, the total number of possible birth month distributions is C(5 + 12 - 1, 12 - 1) which is C(16, 11). Hmm, let me verify that.

Wait, another approach: sometimes these types of problems can also be approached by considering each person independently. Each person can be born in any of the 12 months, so the total number of possible birthday combinations is 12^5, which is 12 multiplied by itself 5 times. But I remember that when considering identical groups (like here, people are indistinct except for their birth months, but months are distinct), the first approach with combinations with repetition is correct. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider both approaches. Let me do that to see which one gives the right result.

First approach: using combinations with repetition. So the total number of ways is C(5 + 12 - 1, 5) = C(16,5). Let's compute that: 16 choose 5 is (16*15*14*13*12)/(5*4*3*2*1) = (16*15*14*13*12)/120. Let me calculate that: 16*15=240, 240*14=3360, 3360*13=43680, 43680*12=524160. Then divide by 120: 524160 / 120. Well, 524160 divided by 120: 524160 / 120 is 524160 divided by 10 is 52416, divided by 12 is 4368. So, 4368.

Alternatively, the second approach: 12^5 is 12*12*12*12*12. Let's compute that: 12^2=144, 144*12=1728, 1728*12=20736, 20736*12=248832. So that's 248,832. Wait, so these two approaches give different numbers. That suggests something is wrong in my reasoning.

Wait a second. Maybe the first approach is incorrect? Because if we model this as placing 5 distinguishable objects (people) into 12 distinguishable boxes (months), with no restrictions, the total number is indeed 12^5. But the first approach I thought was using combinations with repetition, which is typically when the order doesn't matter and we're counting the number of ways to have any number of objects in each box.

Wait, but in this problem, people are distinguishable, but the months are also distinguishable. So perhaps both approaches can actually be equivalent.

Wait, let's clarify. When we use combinations with repetition, we are counting the number of multisets. So, in this problem, we can consider each birth month as a type of object, and each person as a copy of that type. So, the number of multisets is equal to C(16,5). Wait, but if people are distinguishable, is that not the case?

No, actually, no. The thing is, when the objects are distinguishable, you don't use multisets. Each distinguishable object can go into any of the boxes, so the number is indeed 12^5. But in this problem, we want to count the number of ways that two or more people

Alright, so I have this probability problem here: "In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month?" Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to "at least" scenarios. Often, it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. So in this case, the opposite of "at least 2 born in the same month" would be "all 5 people born in different months." That might be a simpler calculation.

But before I dive into that, let me confirm the total number of months in a year. Is it 12? Yeah, 12 months. So, each person can be born in any of these 12 months.

Now, if I have 5 people, each can be born in any of the 12 months. So, the total number of possible birth month combinations is 12 multiplied by itself 5 times, right? That's 12^5. Let me compute that: 12*12=144, 144*12=1728, 1728*12=20736, 20736*12=248832. So, 248,832 total possible combinations.

Okay, now, if I want the probability that all 5 were born in different months, I need to figure out how many ways that can happen. Since each person must be born in a unique month, and there are 12 months, it's similar to assigning each person a different month.

This sounds like a permutation problem. The number of ways to arrange 5 people in 12 months without repetition is given by the permutation formula: P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, where n is the total number of months (12) and k is the number of people (5). So, P(12, 5) = 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7!.

Let me compute that. 12! is 12×11×10×9×8×7!, so when we divide by 7!, it cancels out, leaving 12×11×10×9×8. Let me calculate that step by step:

12 × 11 = 132

132 × 10 = 1320

1320 × 9 = 11,880

11,880 × 8 = 95,040

So, there are 95,040 ways for all 5 people to be born in different months.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 are born in different months is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 95,040 / 248,832.

Let me compute that fraction. Let's see if I can simplify it. Dividing numerator and denominator by 48:

95,040 ÷ 48 = 1,980

248,832 ÷ 48 = 5,184

So, now it's 1,980 / 5,184. Let's see if I can simplify further. Dividing numerator and denominator by 12:

1,980 ÷ 12 = 165

5,184 ÷ 12 = 432

So, now it's 165 / 432. Hmm, can this be simplified more? Let's check the greatest common divisor of 165 and 432.

Prime factors of 165: 5 × 33 = 5 × 3 × 11

Prime factors of 432: 16 × 27 = 2^4 × 3^3

So, the common factor is 3. Dividing numerator and denominator by 3:

165 ÷ 3 = 55

432 ÷ 3 = 144

So, now it's 55 / 144. Hmm, 55 and 144 don't have any common factors besides 1, so that's the simplified fraction.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 people were born in different months is 55/144. So, the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month would be 1 minus that.

So, 1 - 55/144 = (144/144 - 55/144) = 89/144.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.

First, total number of possible outcomes: 12^5 = 248,832. That seems correct.

Number of ways all 5 are born in different months: 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 = 95,040. That also seems correct.

So, 95,040 / 248,832. Let me compute that using another method.

95,040
