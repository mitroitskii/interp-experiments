Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with combinations. Since we're dealing with people being born in different months, I know that there are 12 months in a year, each with equal probability of being someone's birth month. So, each person has a 1/12 chance of being born in January, 1/12 for February, and so on, up to December.

Now, the question is about the probability that at least 2 people were born in the same month. When I see "at least," it often makes me think that it might be easier to calculate the complementary probability and subtract it from 1. The complementary event in this case would be that no two people share the same birth month. So, if I can find the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months, then 1 minus that probability will give me the desired result.

Let me jot that down:

P(at least 2 share a month) = 1 - P(all 5 have different months)

Okay, so next, how do I calculate P(all 5 have different months)? That sounds like a permutation problem, right? Because we're arranging 5 people, each with a unique birth month, out of 12 possible months.

In probability, this is similar to drawing without replacement. So, the first person has 12 possible months, the next person has 11, then 10, and so on. So, the number of favorable outcomes for all 5 people having different months is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

Wait, let me clarify that. Since the first person can be born in any of the 12 months, the second person must be born in a different month, so 11 options, the third person 10, the fourth 9, and the fifth person 8.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. The total number of possible outcomes is 12^5, since each person independently has 12 choices of months.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 people have different birth months is (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) divided by 12^5.

Wait, let me calculate that.

First, calculate the numerator: 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

12 × 11 is 132, 132 × 10 is 1320, 1320 × 9 is 11880, 11880 × 8 is 95040. So, 95040 is the numerator.

Now, the denominator is 12^5. Let's calculate 12^5. 12^1 is 12, 12^2 is 144, 12^3 is 1728, 12^4 is 20736, and 12^5 is 248832.

So, P(all different) = 95040 / 248832. Let's simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 95040. So, 95040 ÷ 95040 = 1, and 248832 ÷ 95040 = approximately 2.619... Wait, maybe I should factor it more.

Alternatively, notice that 95040 × 3 = 285120, which is close to 248832 but actually 248832 is less. Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me compute 95040 ÷ 248832.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 95040 ÷ 48 is 1980, 248832 ÷ 48 is 5184.

So, 1980 / 5184. Now, divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1980 ÷ 12 = 165, 5184 ÷ 12 = 432.

165 / 432. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 165 ÷ 3 = 55, 432 ÷ 3 = 144.

So, we have 55/144. That's approximately 0.3819. So, around 38.19%.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 have different months is 55/144, so the probability that at least 2 share a month is 1 - 55/144.

Let me calculate 1 - 55/144. 144/144 - 55/144 is 89/144. So, 89 divided by 144 is approximately 0.618, so 61.8%.

Wait a second, that seems a bit high, but considering that with 5 people and

Okay, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that probability questions can sometimes be tricky, especially when they involve combinatorics. I remember that "at least 2" often means I should consider the complement probability. Instead of calculating the probability of at least 2 directly, maybe I can calculate the probability that no two people were born in the same month and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the probability of at least 2.

So, let me define the problem more formally. We have 5 people, and each person has a birthday (or birth month) that can be any of the 12 months. I'm assuming that each month is equally likely, right? So, each person has a 1/12 chance of being born in any given month.

To find the probability that at least two people share the same birth month, I'll use the complement rule. The complement of "at least two share the same month" is "all five people have unique birth months." So, if I can find the probability that all five have different months, subtracting that from 1 will give me the desired probability.

Alright, so let's compute the probability that all five birthdays are different months. For the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, since they must be different from the first, there are 11 months left. Similarly, the third person has 10 choices, the fourth has 9, and the fifth has 8. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

But wait, since the order in which the people are considered doesn't matter, I should consider this as a permutation problem. The number of ways to arrange 5 distinct months out of 12 is given by the permutation formula P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So here, n=12 and k=5. Therefore, the number of favorable permutations is P(12,5) = 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7!.

Now, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways all 5 people can have any birth month without any restrictions. Since each person has 12 choices, it's 12^5.

Therefore, the probability that all five birthdays are different is P(12,5) / 12^5. Let me compute that.

First, let me compute P(12,5). 12! / 7! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me calculate that step by step:

12 × 11 = 132

132 × 10 = 1320

1320 × 9 = 11880

11880 × 8 = 95040

So, P(12,5) = 95040.

Now, the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5. Let me compute that:

12^1 = 12

12^2 = 144

12^3 = 1728

12^4 = 20736

12^5 = 248832

So, the probability that all five birthdays are different is 95040 / 248832.

Let me simplify that fraction. Dividing numerator and denominator by 95040:

95040 ÷ 95040 = 1

248832 ÷ 95040 = Let's see, 95040 × 2 = 190080, which is less than 248832. 248832 - 190080 = 58752. So, 2 + 58752 / 95040.

Simplify 58752 / 95040. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 48: 58752 ÷ 48 = 1224, 95040 ÷ 48 = 1980. So, 1224 / 1980. Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1224 ÷12=102, 1980 ÷12=165. So, 102 / 165. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 34 / 55.

So, 58752 / 95040 = 34 / 55.

Therefore, 248832 / 95040 = 2 + 34/55 = 2.618... Or, as a fraction, 2 and 34/55.

So, the probability that all five birthdays are different is 1 / (2 + 34/55) = 1 / (2.618...).

Wait, hold on.
