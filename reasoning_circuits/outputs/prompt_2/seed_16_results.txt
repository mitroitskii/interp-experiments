<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. It's about probability, specifically the probability that in a group of 5 people, at least two share the same birth month. So, I'm dealing with probabilities related to combinations and perhaps the birthday paradox. Wait, isn't this similar to the classic birthday problem? Yes, I think so. In the birthday problem, we calculate the probability that at least two people share the same birthday in a group, given 365 possible days. This problem is similar, but instead of days, it's months, so 12 possible months instead of 365. That might make it a bit easier.

Okay, so the key here is to calculate the probability that at least two people share the same birth month. Probability problems like this often require calculating the complement probability and then subtracting from 1. So, maybe it's easier to calculate the probability that no two people share the same birth month and then subtracting that from 1. That sounds like a good strategy.

Let me recall the formula for this. The probability of at least one success in multiple trials is equal to 1 minus the probability that all trials are failures. So, in this case, the "success" would be that two people share a birth month, and the "failure" would be that no two people share a birth month. Therefore, I need to calculate the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months, which is the probability that no two share a month, and then subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.

So, how do I calculate the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months? Well, since each person can be born in any of the 12 months, we can model this as permutations. For the first person, there are 12 possible months. For the second person, there are 11 remaining months, because one month is already taken by the first person. For the third person, there are 10 months left, and so on, down to 12 - 4 = 8 months for the fifth person.

Wait, so is that right? Because for each subsequent person, the number of available months decreases by one. So, it's like 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. But since the order doesn't matter here, because we're just counting the number of ways this can happen, we should be using combinations instead of permutations? Wait, no, actually, no, because each person is a distinct individual, and their birth months are being assigned one by one, without replacement. So, perhaps it's better to model this as a permutation.

So, the total number of possible birthday combinations for 5 people is 12^5, because each of the 5 people can have any of the 12 months. However, that includes all possible assignments, including those where multiple people share the same month. So, when we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where all have unique months, it would be 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8, which is the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time.

Therefore, the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months is (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) divided by 12^5. Then, the probability that at least two share a month is 1 minus that value.

Let me write that down to clarify:

Probability(no two share a month) = (12! / (12 - 5)!) / 12^5

Simplifying the numerator: 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 = 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7!.

So, yes, that expression is correct.

Therefore, the probability that at least two share a month is:

1 - (12! / 7! ) / 12^5

Now, let me compute this value step by step.

First, compute 12! which is 12 factorial.

12! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7! So, but since we have 12! / 7!, that simplifies to 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 = 95040.

Wait, is that correct? Let me multiply step by step:

12 × 11 = 132

132 × 10 = 1320

1320 × 9 = 11880

11880 × 8 = 95040.

Yes, so 12! / 7! is

Alright, so I have this probability problem: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that probability problems can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with "at least" scenarios. In this case, it's about at least two people sharing the same birth month. So, I think the best approach might be to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be that all 5 people were born in different months. If I can find the probability of that, then subtracting it from 1 should give me the probability that at least two share the same month.

Let me make sure I understand this correctly. The months are from 1 to 12, right? So, there are 12 possible months. If I have 5 people, each could be born in any of these 12 months. Now, the question is about the probability that at least two share the same month. So, the complement is that all 5 have unique birth months, meaning each is born in a different month. So, if I can find the probability that all 5 are born in different months, then 1 minus that probability will be the answer.

Okay, so let's break it down. The probability that all 5 people have different birth months is equal to the number of ways to assign each person a unique month divided by the total number of possible ways they could be assigned any month. That sounds like a permutation problem.

Let me recall, the total number of possible outcomes when assigning birth months to 5 people is 12 options for the first person, 11 for the second, 10 for the third, 9 for the fourth, and 8 for the fifth. So, that would be 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Alternatively, this can be written as 12P5, which is the number of permutations of 12 months taken 5 at a time.

Calculating that, 12P5 = 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7! Let me compute that. 12! is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7!, so when we divide by 7!, it cancels out, leaving us with 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8. Let me compute that: 12 × 11 is 132, 132 × 10 is 1320, 1320 × 9 is 11880, 11880 × 8 is 95040. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 95040.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes for the complementary event, where all 5 have different birth months, is the number of ways to assign each person a unique month. Since there are 12 months and 5 people, this is essentially 12 choose 5, but since order matters here because each person is distinct, it should be a permutation. So, it's 12P5, which we've already calculated as 95040. Wait, hold on, that can't be right because if it's the same as the total number of possible outcomes, then the probability would be 1, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, actually, no. Let me think again. If the event is that all 5 people have different birth months, the number of favorable outcomes is actually the number of injective functions from the set of 5 people to the set of 12 months. That is indeed 12P5, which is 95040. But the total number of possible outcomes is also 12^5, which is the number of functions from 5 people to 12 months. Let me compute 12^5: 12 × 12 is 144, 144 × 12 is 1728, 1728 × 12 is 20736, 20736 × 12 is 248832. So, 12^5 is 248832.

Ah, so the total number of possible outcomes is 248832, and the number of favorable outcomes for the complementary event is 95040. Therefore, the probability that all 5 people have different birth months is 95040 / 248832. Let me compute that. Dividing numerator and denominator by 95040: 95040 / 95040 is 1, and 248832 / 95040 is approximately 2.622. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me do the division properly.

Dividing 95040 by 248832: Let's see, 95040 × 2 is 190080, subtract that from
