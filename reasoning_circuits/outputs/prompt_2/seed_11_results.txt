<｜User｜>In a group of 5 people, what's the probability at least 2 were born in the same month?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this probability problem to solve: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First off, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps. The question is asking for the probability that at least two people were born in the same month. That means we're looking for the chance that two or more share the same birth month, out of five people.

I think a good starting point is to consider the opposite probability. That is, instead of calculating the probability of at least two people sharing a month, maybe I can calculate the probability that all five people are born in different months. Then, subtracting that from 1 should give me the desired probability. Yeah, that seems manageable.

So, to do that, I need to know how many months there are. Well, assuming it's a standard year with 12 months, unless specified otherwise. So, 12 months in total.

Now, for each person, the probability of being born in a particular month is 1/12, right? And the choices are independent from each other since each person's birth month doesn't affect another's. So, for the first person, probability is 1/12, but for the second person, it's also 1/12, but we don't want them to share a month.

Wait, hold on. Actually, this might get more complicated than I thought. Let's think of it combinatorially. When dealing with probabilities of events not happening, sometimes it's easier to use the concept of permutations.

So, if all five people must have unique birth months, how many ways can this happen? Well, the first person can be born in any month, 12 options. The second person has 11 options because they can't be the same as the first, the third person has 10, then 9, and so on. So, it's like 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

But wait, another way to think about this is using permutations. Since each person's birth month is being assigned without repetition, the number of ways is 12P5, which is equal to 12! / (12 - 5)! = 12! / 7!.

But I need the probability of this happening, so that's the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

The total number of possible birth month combinations for five people is 12^5, because each person has 12 independent choices.

So, the probability that all five people have unique birth months is (12P5) / 12^5, which is (12! / 7!) / 12^5.

Thus, the probability that at least two people share a birth month is 1 minus that probability.

Let me write that down:

P(at least two share a month) = 1 - P(all five unique)

So, let me compute 12P5 first. 12P5 is 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8.

Calculating that:

12 × 11 is 132

132 × 10 is 1320

1320 × 9 is 11880

11880 × 8 is 95040.

So, 12P5 is 95040.

Now, the total number of possible outcomes is 12^5.

Calculating 12^5: 12 × 12 is 144, ×12 is 1728, ×12 is 20736, ×12 is 248832.

So, 12^5 is 248832.

Therefore, the probability that all five people are born in different months is 95040 / 248832.

Let me simplify that fraction.

First, see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by 95040.

Wait, 248832 divided by 95040 is approximately 2.62, but to simplify the fraction, let's divide numerator and denominator by 95040:

95040 ÷ 95040 = 1

248832 ÷ 95040 = 2.62... Hmm, not a whole number. Maybe I can factor both numbers into primes.

Alternatively, let me try dividing both by 24: 95040 ÷ 24 = 3960, and 248832 ÷ 24 = 10368.

So, now it's 3960 / 10368.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 3960 ÷ 48 = 82.5, which is not an integer. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, let's see if both have a common divisor of 48, which is 16 × 3. Wait, 950

Alright, so I have this probability problem here: In a group of 5 people, what's the probability that at least 2 were born in the same month? Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but I think this is a classic birthday problem. The classic question is, how many people do you need in a room for there to be a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday. I think the answer is around 23 people, but this question is about months instead of days, so it's a bit different.

First, let me clarify what the question is asking. It's about 5 people, and we need to find the probability that at least two were born in the same month. So, in other words, what's the chance that among the 5 people, two or more share the same birth month. Hmm, okay.

I think the way to approach this is by calculating the probability of the complementary event and then subtracting it from 1. The complementary event in this case would be that all 5 people were born in different months. So, if I can find the probability that all 5 have unique birth months, then subtract that from 1, I'll get the probability that at least two share a month.

Alright, so let's break it down. First, how many months are there in a year? Well, assuming we're talking about the Gregorian calendar, there are 12 months. So, 12 possible months.

So, for the first person, the probability of being born in any particular month is 1, because they have to be born in one of the 12 months. For the second person, the probability that they were born in a different month than the first person is 11/12, because there are 11 remaining months.

Wait, hold on, actually, when calculating the probability that all 5 people have unique months, we can model it step by step. So, the first person can be born in any month, the second person has to be born in a different month, the third person has to be born in a different month than the first two, and so on.

So, the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months is equal to:

(11/12) * (10/11) * (9/10) * (8/9) * (7/8)

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me think. Actually, for the first person, the probability is 1, because they can be born in any month. For the second person, the probability that they are born in a different month is 11/12. For the third person, the probability that they are born in a different month from the first two is 10/11. For the fourth person, it's 9/10, and for the fifth person, it's 8/9.

So, multiplying all these together: 1 * (11/12) * (10/11) * (9/10) * (8/9). Hmm, let me compute that. Let's write it out:

(11/12) * (10/11) * (9/10) * (8/9) * (7/8). Wait, actually, for 5 people, it should go up to 8/9 for the fifth person? Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, no, for the fifth person, it's the fourth denominator. Wait, let me clarify. Let me think of it as the probability that each subsequent person is born in a new month.

So, for the first person, probability 1. For the second person, 11/12. Third person, 10/11. Fourth person, 9/10. Fifth person, 8/9. So, the total probability that all 5 have unique months is 1 * (11/12) * (10/11) * (9/10) * (8/9).

Wait, hold on, when I write it out, the numerators and denominators cancel out. Let's see:

1 * (11/12) * (10/11) * (9/10) * (8/9) = (1) * (11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) = (1) * (8) / (12) = 8/12 = 2/3.

Wait, that can't be right because 8/12 is 2/3, which is approximately 0.6667. So, the probability that all 5 people have unique birth months is 2/3. Therefore, the probability that at least two share a month is 1 - 2/3 =
